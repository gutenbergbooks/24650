<h3 class="italic">AN EXTRAORDINARY PIRATICAL PLOT</h3>

<p class="italic">A most curiously well-concocted piratical scheme to publish, without
his knowledge or consent, a complete collection of Mr. Whistler's

<span class="sidenoteright">"American Register," Paris, March 8, 1890.</span>

writings, letters, pamphlets, lectures, &amp;c., has been nipped in the
bud on the very eve of its accomplishment. It appears that the book
was actually in type and ready for issue, but the plan was to bring
out the work simultaneously in England and America. This caused delay,
the plates having to be shipped to New York, and the strain of secrecy
upon the conspirators during the interval would seem to have been too
great. In any case indications of surrounding mystery, quite
sufficient to arouse Mr. Whistler's attention, brought about his rapid
action. Messrs. Lewis and Lewis were instructed to take out immediate
injunction against the publication in both England and America, and
this information, at once cabled across, warning all publishers in the
United States, exploded the plot, effectually frustrating the
elaborate machinations of those engaged in it.</p>

<h3 class="italic">SEIZURE OF MR WHISTLER'S PIRATED WRITINGS</h3>

<p class="italic">This pirated collection of letters, writings, &amp;c.,

<span class="sidenoteleft">"New York Herald," London Edition, March 23,
1890.</span>

to whose
frustrated publication in this country and America we have already
alluded, was seized in Antwerp, at the printers', on Friday last&mdash;the
very day of its contracted delivery. The persistent and really
desperate speculator in this volume of difficult birth, baffled in his
attempt to produce it in London and New York had been tracked to
Antwerp by Messrs. Lewis and Lewis; and he was finally brought down by
Maître Maeterlinck, the distinguished lawyer of that city.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevii" name="pagevii"></a>(p. vii)</span>
<h3 class="italic">THE EXPLODED PLOT</h3>

<p class="italic">With regard to this matter, to which we have already alluded on a
previous occasion, Messrs. Lewis and Lewis have received the following
letter from Messrs. Field and Tuer, of the Leadenhall Press, dated
March 25, 1890:&mdash;<br>

<span class="sidenoteright">"Pall Mall Gazette," March 27, 1890.</span>

"We have seen the paragraph in yesterday's 'Pall Mall Gazette'
relating to the publication of Mr. Whistler's letters. You may like to
know that we recently put into type for a certain person a series of
Mr. Whistlers letters and other matter, taking it for granted that Mr.
Whistler had given permission. Quite recently, however, and
fortunately in time to stop the work being printed, we were told that
Mr. Whistler objected to his letters being published. We then sent for
the person in question, and told him that until he obtained Mr.
Whistler's sanction we declined to proceed further with the work,
which, we may tell you, is finished and cast ready for printing, and
the type distributed. From the time of this interview we have not seen
or heard from the person in question, and there the matter rests."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageviii" name="pageviii"></a>(p. viii)</span>
<h3 class="italic">MR. WHISTLER'S PAPER HUNT</h3>

<p class="italic">The fruitless attempt to publish without his consent, or rather in
spite of his opposition, the collected writings of Mr. Whistler has

<span class="sidenoteleft">"Sunday Times," March 30, 1890.</span>

developed into a species of chase from press to press, and from
country to country. With an extraordinary fatality, the unfortunate
fugitive has been invariably allowed to reach the very verge of
achievement before he was surprised by the long arm of Messrs. Lewis
and Lewis. Each defeat has been consequently attended with infinite
loss of labour, material and money. Our readers have been told how the
London venture came to nought, and how it was frustrated in America.
The venue was then changed, and Belgium, as a neutral ground, was
supposed possible; but here again, on the very day of its delivery,
the edition of 2000 vols. was seized by M. le Procureur du Roi, and
under the nose of the astounded and discomfited speculator, the packed
and corded bales, of which he was about to take possession, were
carried off in the Government van! The upshot of the untiring efforts
of this persistent adventurer at length results in furnishing Mr.
Whistler with the first and only copy of this curious work, which was
certainly anything but the intention of its compiler, who clearly,
judging from its contents, had reserved for him an unpleasing if not
crushing surprise!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageix" name="pageix"></a>(p. ix)</span>
<h3 class="italic">A GREAT LITERARY CURIOSITY</h3>

<div class="italic">
<p>I have to-day seen the printed book itself of the Collected Writings
of Mr. Whistler,

<span class="sidenoteright">"Pall Mall Gazette." March 1890.</span>

whose publication has proved so comically impossible.
The style of the preface and accessory comments is in the worst style
of Western editorship; while the disastrous effect of Mr. Whistler's
literature upon the one who has burned his fingers with it, is
amusingly shown.</p>

<p>In the index occur such well-known names as Mr. J. C. Horsley, R.A.,
Mr. Labouchere, Mr. Ruskin, Mr. Linley Sambourne, Mr. Swinburne, Tom
Taylor, Mr. Frith, and Rossetti. The famous catalogue of the "Second
Exhibition of Venice Etchings, February 19, 1883," in which Mr.
Whistler quotes the critics, is also given.</p>

<h3 class="italic">A LAST EFFORT</h3>

<p class="italic">We hear that a third attempt has been made to produce the pirated
copy of Mr. Whistler's

<span class="sidenoteleft">"Pall Mall Gazette," April 9, 1890.</span>

collected writings. Messrs. Lewis and Lewis
have at once taken legal steps to stop the edition (printed in Paris)
at the Customs. A cablegram has been received by Mr. Whistler's
solicitors stating that Messrs. Stokes's name has been affixed to the
title-page of the pirated book without the sanction of those
publishers.</p>

<p class="right smcap">john ruskin.</p>

<h3 class="italic"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page002" name="page002"></a>(p. 002)</span> The Action</h3>

<p>In the Court of Exchequer Division on Monday, before Baron Huddleston
and a special jury, the case of Whistler <span class="italic">v.</span> Ruskin

<span class="sidenoteright">Lawsuit for Libel against Mr. Ruskin Nov. 15, 1878.</span>

came on for hearing.
In this action the plaintiff claimed £1000 damages.</p>

<p>Mr. Serjeant Parry and Mr. Petheram appeared for the plaintiff; and
the Attorney-General and Mr. Bowen represented the defendant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Serjeant Parry</span>, in opening the case on behalf of the plaintiff,
said that Mr. Whistler had followed the profession of an artist for
many years, both in this and other countries. Mr. Ruskin, as would be
probably known to the gentlemen of the jury, held perhaps the highest
position in Europe and America as an art critic, and some of his works
were, he might say, destined to immortality. He was, in fact, a
gentleman of the highest reputation. In the July number of <span class="italic">Fors
Clavigera</span> there appeared passages in which Mr. Ruskin criticised what
he called "the modern <span class="pagenum"><a id="page003" name="page003"></a>(p. 003)</span> school," and then followed the
paragraph of which Mr. Whistler now complained, and which was: "For
Mr. Whistler's own sake, no less than for the protection of the
purchaser, Sir Coutts Lindsay ought not to have admitted works into
the gallery in which the ill-educated conceit of the artist so nearly
approached the aspect of wilful imposture. I have seen, and heard,
much of cockney impudence before now; but never expected to hear a
coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the
public's face." That passage, no doubt, had been read by thousands,
and so it had gone forth to the world that Mr. Whistler was an
ill-educated man, an impostor, a cockney pretender, and an impudent
coxcomb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whistler</span>, cross-examined by the <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span>, said: "I have
sent pictures to the Academy which have not been received. I believe
that is the experience of all artists.... The nocturne in black and
gold is a night piece, and represents the fireworks at Cremorne."</p>

<p>"Not a view of Cremorne?"</p>

<p>"If it were called a view of Cremorne, it would certainly bring about
nothing but disappointment on the part of the beholders. (<span class="italic">Laughter.</span>)
It is an artistic arrangement. It was marked two hundred guineas."</p>

<p>"Is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page004" name="page004"></a>(p. 004)</span> not that what we, who are not artists, would call a
stiffish price?"</p>

<p>"I think it very likely that that may be so."</p>

<p>"But artists always give good value for their money, don't they?"</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that so well established. (<span class="italic">A laugh.</span>) I do not
know Mr. Ruskin, or that he holds the view that a picture should only
be exhibited when it is finished, when nothing can be done to improve
it, but that is a correct view; the arrangement in black and gold was
a finished picture, I did not intend to do anything more to it."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Whistler. Can you tell me how long it took you to knock off
that nocturne?"</p>

<p>... "I beg your pardon?" (<span class="italic">Laughter.</span>)</p>

<p>"Oh! I am afraid that I am using a term that applies rather perhaps to
my own work. I should have said, How long did you take to paint that
picture?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! permit me, I am too greatly flattered to think that you
apply, to work of mine, any term that you are in the habit of using
with reference to your own. Let us say then how long did I take
to&mdash;'knock off,' I think that is it&mdash;to knock off that nocturne; well,
as well as I remember, about a day."</p>

<p>"Only a day?"</p>

<p>"Well, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page005" name="page005"></a>(p. 005)</span> I won't be quite positive; I may have still put a few
more touches to it the next day if the painting were not dry. I had
better say then, that I was two days at work on it."</p>

<p>"Oh, two days! The labour of two days, then, is that for which you ask
two hundred guineas!"</p>

<p>"No;&mdash;I ask it for the knowledge of a lifetime." (<span class="italic">Applause.</span>)</p>

<p>"You have been told that your pictures exhibit some eccentricities?"</p>

<p>"Yes; often." (<span class="italic">Laughter.</span>)</p>

<p>"You send them to the galleries to incite the admiration of the
public?"</p>

<p>"That would be such vast absurdity on my part, that I don't think I
could." (<span class="italic">Laughter.</span>)</p>

<p>"You know that many critics entirely disagree with your views as to
these pictures?"</p>

<p>"It would be beyond me to agree with the critics."</p>

<p>"You don't approve of criticism then?"</p>

<p>"I should not disapprove in any way of technical criticism by a man
whose whole life is passed in the practice of the science which he
criticises; but for the opinion of a man whose life is not so passed I
would have as little regard as you would, if he expressed an opinion
on law."</p>

<p>"You expect to be criticised?"</p>

<p>"Yes; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page006" name="page006"></a>(p. 006)</span> certainly. And I do not expect to be affected by it,
until it becomes a case of this kind. It is not only when criticism is
inimical that I object to it, but also when it is incompetent. I hold
that none but an artist can be a competent critic."</p>

<p>"You put your pictures upon the garden wall, Mr. Whistler, or hang
them on the clothes line, don't you&mdash;to mellow?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Do you not put your paintings out into the garden?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I understand now. I thought, at first, that you were perhaps
again using a term that you are accustomed to yourself. Yes; I
certainly do put the canvases into the garden that they may dry in the
open air while I am painting, but I should be sorry to see them
'mellowed.'"</p>

<p>"Why do you call Mr. Irving 'an arrangement in black'?" (<span class="italic">Laughter.</span>)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baron Huddleston</span>: "It is the picture and not Mr. Irving that is
the arrangement."</p>

<p>A discussion ensued as to the inspection of the pictures, and
incidentally Baron Huddleston remarked that a critic must be competent
to form an opinion, and bold enough to express that opinion in strong
terms if necessary.</p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page007" name="page007"></a>(p. 007)</span> <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span> complained that no answer was given to a
written application by the defendant's solicitors for leave to inspect
the pictures which the plaintiff had been called upon to produce at
the trial. The <span class="smcap">Witness</span> replied that Mr. Arthur Severn had been to his
studio to inspect the paintings, on behalf of the defendant, for the
purpose of passing his final judgment upon them and settling that
question for ever.</p>

<p>Cross-examination continued: "What was the subject of the nocturne in
blue and silver belonging to Mr. Grahame?"</p>

<p>"A moonlight effect on the river near old Battersea Bridge."</p>

<p>"What has become of the nocturne in black and gold?"</p>

<p>"I believe it is before you." (<span class="italic">Laughter.</span>)</p>

<p>The picture called the nocturne in blue and silver, was now produced
in Court.</p>

<p>"That is Mr. Grahame's picture. It represents Battersea Bridge by
moonlight."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baron Huddleston</span>: "Which part of the picture is the bridge?"
(<span class="italic">Laughter.</span>)</p>

<p>His Lordship earnestly rebuked those who laughed. And witness
explained to his Lordship the composition of the picture.</p>

<p>"Do <span class="pagenum"><a id="page008" name="page008"></a>(p. 008)</span> you say that this is a correct representation of
Battersea Bridge?"</p>

<p>"I did not intend it to be a 'correct' portrait of the bridge. It is
only a moonlight scene and the pier in the centre of the picture may
not be like the piers at Battersea Bridge as you know them in broad
daylight. As to what the picture represents that depends upon who
looks at it. To some persons it may represent all that is intended; to
others it may represent nothing."</p>

<p>"The prevailing colour is blue?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Are those figures on the top of the bridge intended for people?"</p>

<p>"They are just what you like."</p>

<p>"Is that a barge beneath?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I am very much encouraged at your perceiving that. My whole
scheme was only to bring about a certain harmony of colour."</p>

<p>"What is that gold-coloured mark on the right of the picture like a
cascade?"</p>

<p>"The 'cascade of gold' is a firework."</p>

<p>A second nocturne in blue and silver was then produced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: "That represents another moonlight scene on the Thames
looking up Battersea Reach. I completed the mass of the picture in one
day."</p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009"></a>(p. 009)</span> Court then adjourned. During the interval the jury
visited the Probate Court to view the pictures which had been
collected in the Westminster Palace Hotel.</p>

<p>After the Court had re-assembled the "Nocturne in Black and Gold" was
again produced, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Whistler</span> was further cross-examined by the
<span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span>: "The picture represents a distant view of Cremorne
with a falling rocket and other fireworks. It occupied two days, and
is a finished picture. The black monogram on the frame was placed in
its position with reference to the proper decorative balance of the
whole."</p>

<p>"You have made the study of Art your study of a lifetime. Now, do you
think that anybody looking at that picture might fairly come to the
conclusion that it had no peculiar beauty?"</p>

<p>"I have strong evidence that Mr. Ruskin did come to that conclusion."</p>

<p>"Do you think it fair that Mr. Ruskin should come to that conclusion?"</p>

<p>"What might be fair to Mr. Ruskin I cannot answer."</p>

<p>"Then you mean, Mr. Whistler, that the initiated in technical matters
might have no difficulty in understanding your work. But do you think
now that you could make <span class="italic">me</span> see the beauty of that picture?"</p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010"></a>(p. 010)</span> witness then paused, and examining attentively the
Attorney-General's face and looking at the picture alternately, said,
after apparently giving the subject much thought, while the Court
waited in silence for his answer:</p>

<p>"No! Do you know I fear it would be as hopeless as for the musician to
pour his notes into the ear of a deaf man. (<span class="italic">Laughter.</span>)</p>

<p>"I offer the picture, which I have conscientiously painted, as being
worth two hundred guineas. I have known unbiassed people express the
opinion that it represents fireworks in a night-scene. I would not
complain of any person who might simply take a different view."</p>

<p>The Court then adjourned.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span>, in resuming his address on behalf of the
defendant on Tuesday, said he hoped to convince the jury, before his
case closed, that Mr. Ruskin's criticism upon the plaintiff's pictures
was perfectly fair and <span class="italic">bonâ fide</span>;[1]

and that, however severe it
might be, there was nothing that could reasonably be complained of....
Let them examine the nocturne in blue and silver, said to represent
Battersea Bridge. What was that structure in the middle? Was it a
telescope or a fire-escape? Was it like Battersea Bridge? What were
the figures at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page011" name="page011"></a>(p. 011)</span> the top of the bridge? And if they were
horses and carts, how in the name of fortune were they to get off?
Now, about these pictures, if the plaintiff's argument was to avail,
they must not venture publicly to express an opinion, or they would
have brought against them an action for damages.</p>

<p>After all, Critics had their uses.[2]

He should like to know what
would become of Poetry, of Politics, of Painting, if Critics were to

<p>No Artist could obtain fame, except through criticism.[3]

<p>... Coming to the libel, the Attorney-General said it had been
contended that Mr. Ruskin was not justified in interfering with a
man's livelihood. But why not? Then it was said, "Oh! you have
ridiculed Mr. Whistler's pictures." If Mr. Whistler disliked ridicule,
he should not have subjected himself to it by exhibiting publicly such
productions. If a man thought a picture was a daub[4]
<span class="sidenoteleft" title="Footnote 4"><span class="tiny">[4]</span>"Now it is evident that in Rembrandt's

<p>Mr. Ruskin entertaining those views, it was not wonderful that his

the pictures, if they chose,[7]

conceit of the artist, so nearly
approaching the action of imposture." If his pictures were mere
extravagances, how could it redound to the credit of Mr. Whistler to
send them to the Grosvenor Gallery to be exhibited? Some artistic
gentleman from Manchester, Leeds, or Sheffield might perhaps be
induced to buy one of the pictures because it was a Whistler, and what
Mr. Ruskin meant was that he might better have remained in Manchester,
Sheffield, or Leeds, with his money in his pocket. It was said that
the term "ill-educated conceit" ought never to have been applied to
Mr. Whistler, who had devoted the whole of his life to educating
himself in Art;[9]

<span class="sidenoteleft" title="Footnote 9"><span class="tiny">[9]</span>"And thus we are guided, almost forced, by

              been, but by the definite Divine appointment for the

old idea of the licensed jester who wore a cap and bells with a cock's
comb in it, who went about making jests for the amusement of his
master and family. If that were the true definition, then Mr. Whistler

one syllable of his criticism, believing it was right. Of course, if

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Serjeant Parry</span> objected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baron Huddleston</span>: "You will have to prove that it is a Titian."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowen</span>: "I shall be able to do that."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page016" name="page016"></a>(p. 016)</span> <span class="smcap">Baron Huddleston</span>: "That can only be by repute. I do not
want to raise a laugh, but there is a well-known case of 'an
undoubted' Titian being purchased with a view to enabling students and
others to find out how to produce his wonderful colours. With that
object the picture was rubbed down, and they found a red surface,
beneath which they thought was the secret, but on continuing the
rubbing they discovered a full length portrait of George III. in
uniform!"</p>

<p>The witness was then asked to look at the picture, and he said: "It is
a portrait of Doge Andrea Gritti, and I believe it is a real Titian.
It shows finish. It is a very perfect sample of the highest finish of
ancient art.[17]

              not represent adequately the style and qualities which

round and good. That is an 'arrangement in flesh and blood!'"</p>

<p>The witness having pointed out the excellences of that portrait, said:
"I think Mr. Whistler had great powers at first, which he has not
since justified. He has evaded the difficulties of his art, because
the difficulty of an artist increases every day of his professional
life."</p>

is a mere accident of the saleroom."</p>

thousands to me."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frith</span> was then examined: "I am an R.A.; and have devoted my life
to painting. I am a member of the Academies of various countries. I am
the author of the 'Railway Station,' 'Derby Day,' and 'Rake's
Progress.' I have seen Mr. Whistler's pictures, and in my opinion they
are not serious works of art.

</span>
The nocturne in black and gold is not a
serious work to me. I cannot see anything of the true representation
of water and atmosphere in the painting of 'Battersea Bridge.' There
is a pretty colour which pleases the eye, but there is nothing more.
To my thinking, the description of moonlight is not true. The picture
is not worth two hundred guineas. Composition and detail are most
important matters in a picture. In our profession men of equal merit
differ as to the character of a picture. One may blame, while another
praises, a work. I have not exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery. I have
read Mr. Ruskin's works."</p>

pictures than a delicately tinted wall-paper.'"

<h3 class="italic">Whistler <span class="pagenum"><a id="page025" name="page025"></a>(p. 025)</span> v. Ruskin: Art and Art Critics</h3>

<p>The <span class="italic">fin mot</span> and spirit of this matter seems to have been utterly
missed, or perhaps willingly winked at, by the journals in their
comments. Their correspondents have persistently, and not unnaturally
as writers, seen nothing beyond the immediate case in law&mdash;viz., the
difference between Mr. Ruskin and myself, culminating in the libel
with a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>

<p>Now the war, of which the opening skirmish was fought the other day in
Westminster, is really one between the brush and the pen; and involves
literally, as the Attorney-General himself hinted, the absolute
"raison d'être" of the critic. The cry, on their part, of "Il faut
vivre," I most certainly meet, in this case, with the appropriate
answer, "Je n'en vois pas la nécessité."</p>

<p>Far from me, at that stage of things, to go further into this
discussion than I did, when, cross-examined by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page026" name="page026"></a>(p. 026)</span> Sir John
Holker, I contented myself with the general answer, "that one might
admit criticism when emanating from a man who had passed his whole
life in the science which he attacks." The position of Mr. Ruskin as
an art authority we left quite unassailed during the trial. To have
said that Mr. Ruskin's pose among intelligent men, as other than a
<span class="italic">littérateur</span> is false and ridiculous, would have been an invitation
to the stake; and to be burnt alive, or stoned before the verdict, was
not what I came into court for.</p>

<p>Over and over again did the Attorney-General cry out aloud, in the
agony of his cause, "What is to become of painting if the critics
withhold their lash?"</p>

<p>As well might he ask what is to become of mathematics under similar
circumstances, were they possible. I maintain that two and two the
mathematician would continue to make four, in spite of the whine of
the amateur for three, or the cry of the critic for five. We are told
that Mr. Ruskin has devoted his long life to art, and as a result&mdash;is
"Slade Professor" at Oxford. In the same sentence, we have thus his
position and its worth. It suffices not, Messieurs! a life passed
among pictures makes not a painter&mdash;else the policeman in the National
Gallery might assert himself. As well allege that he who lives in a
library <span class="pagenum"><a id="page027" name="page027"></a>(p. 027)</span> must needs die a poet. Let not Mr. Ruskin flatter
himself that more education makes the difference between himself and
the policeman when both stand gazing in the Gallery.</p>

<p>There they might remain till the end of time; the one decently silent,
the other saying, in good English, many high-sounding empty things,
like the cracking of thorns under a pot&mdash;undismayed by the presence of
the Masters with whose names he is sacrilegiously familiar; whose
intentions he interprets, whose vices he discovers with the facility
of the incapable, and whose virtues he descants upon with a verbosity
and flow of language that would, could he hear it, give Titian the
same shock of surprise that was Balaam's, when the first great critic
proffered his opinion.</p>

<p>This one instance apart, where collapse was immediate, the creature
Critic is of comparatively modern growth&mdash;and certainly, in perfect
condition, of recent date. To his completeness go qualities evolved
from the latest lightnesses of to-day&mdash;indeed, the <span class="italic">fine fleur</span> of his
type is brought forth in Paris, and beside him the Englishman is but
rough-hewn and blundering after all; though not unkindly should one
say it, as reproaching him with inferiority resulting from chances
neglected.</p>

<p>The truth is, as compared with his brother of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page028" name="page028"></a>(p. 028)</span>
Boulevards, the Briton was badly begun by nature.</p>

<p>To take himself seriously is the fate of the humbug at home, and
destruction to the jaunty career of the art critic, whose essence of
success lies in his strong sense of his ephemeral existence, and his
consequent horror of <span class="italic">ennuyer</span>ing his world&mdash;in short, to perceive the
joke of life is rarely given to our people, whilst it forms the
mainspring of the Parisian's <span class="italic">savoir plaire</span>. The finesse of the
Frenchman, acquired in long loafing and clever <span class="italic">café</span> cackle&mdash;the glib
go and easy assurance of the <span class="italic">petit crevé</span>, combined with the <span class="italic">chic</span>
of great habit&mdash;the brilliant <span class="italic">blague</span> of the ateliers&mdash;the aptitude
of their <span class="italic">argot</span>&mdash;the fling of the <span class="italic">Figaro</span>, and the knack of short
paragraphs, which allows him to print of a picture "C'est bien écrit!"
and of a subject, "C'est bien dit!"&mdash;these are elements of an
<span class="italic">ensemble</span> impossible in this island.</p>

<p>Still, we are "various" in our specimens, and a sense of progress is
noticeable when we look about among them.</p>

<p>Indications of their period are perceptible, and curiously enough a
similarity is suggested, by their work, between themselves and the
vehicles we might fancy carrying them about to their livelihood.</p>

<p>Tough old Tom, the busy City 'Bus, with its heavy jolting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page029" name="page029"></a>(p. 029)</span>
and many halts; its steady, sturdy, stodgy continuance on the same old
much worn way, every turning known, and freshness unhoped for; its
patient dreary dulness of daily duty to its cheap company&mdash;struggling
on to its end, nevertheless, and pulling up at the Bank! with a
flourish from the driver, and a joke from the cad at the door.</p>

<p>Then the contributors to the daily papers: so many hansoms bowling
along that the moment may not be lost, and the <span class="italic">à propos</span> gone for
ever. The one or two broughams solemnly rolling for reviews, while the
lighter bicycle zigzags irresponsibly in among them for the happy
Halfpennies.</p>

<p>What a commerce it all is, to be sure!</p>

<p>No sham in it either!&mdash;no "bigod nonsense!" they are all "doing
good"&mdash;yes, they all do good to Art. Poor Art! what a sad state the
slut is in, an these gentlemen shall help her. The artist alone, by
the way, is to no purpose, and remains unconsulted; his work is
explained and rectified without him, by the one who was never in
it&mdash;but upon whom God, always good, though sometimes careless, has
thrown away the knowledge refused to the author&mdash;poor devil!</p>

<p>The Attorney-General said, "There are some people who would do away
with critics altogether."</p>

<p>I agree with him, and am of the irrationals he points <span class="pagenum"><a id="page030" name="page030"></a>(p. 030)</span>
at&mdash;but let me be clearly understood&mdash;the <span class="italic">art</span> critic alone would I
extinguish. That writers should destroy writings to the benefit of
writing is reasonable. Who but they shall insist upon beauties of
literature, and discard the demerits of their brother <span class="italic">littérateurs</span>?
In their turn they will be destroyed by other writers, and the merry
game goes on till truth prevail. Shall the painter then&mdash;I foresee the
question&mdash;decide upon painting? Shall <span class="italic">he</span> be the critic and sole
authority? Aggressive as is this supposition, I fear that, in the
length of time, his assertion alone has established what even the
gentlemen of the quill accept as the canons of art, and recognise as
the masterpieces of work.</p>

<p>Let work, then, be received in silence, as it was in the days to which
the penmen still point as an era when art was at its apogee. And here
we come upon the oft-repeated apology of the critic for existing at
all, and find how complete is his stultification. He brands himself as
the necessary blister for the health of the painter, and writes that
he may do good to his art. In the same ink he bemoans the decadence
about him, and declares that the best work was done when he was not
there to help it. No! let there be no critics! they are not a
"necessary evil," but an evil quite unnecessary, though an evil
certainly.</p>

<p>Harm <span class="pagenum"><a id="page031" name="page031"></a>(p. 031)</span> they do, and not good.</p>

<p>Furnished as they are with the means of furthering their foolishness,
they spread prejudice abroad; and through the papers, at their
service, thousands are warned against the work they have yet to look
upon.</p>

<p>And here one is tempted to go further, and show the crass idiocy and
impertinence of those whose dicta are printed as law.</p>

<p>How he of the <span class="italic">Times</span>[18]
<span class="sidenoteright" title="Footnote 18"><span class="tiny">[18]</span>June 6, 1874</span>
has found Velasquez "slovenly in execution,
poor in colour&mdash;being little but a combination of neutral greys and
ugly in its forms"&mdash;how he grovelled in happiness over a Turner&mdash;that
was no Turner at all, as Mr. Ruskin wrote to show&mdash;Ruskin! whom he has
since defended. Ah! Messieurs, what our neighbours call "la malice des
choses" was unthought of, and the sarcasm of fate was against you. How
Gerard Dow's broom was an example for the young; and Canaletti and
Paul Veronese are to be swept aside&mdash;doubtless with it. How Rembrandt
is coarse, and Carlo Dolci noble&mdash;with more of this kind. But what
does it matter?</p>

<p>"What does anything matter!" The farce will go on, and its solemnity
adds to the fun.</p>

<p>Mediocrity flattered at acknowledging mediocrity, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page032" name="page032"></a>(p. 032)</span>
mistaking mystification for mastery, enters the fog of dilettantism,
and, graduating connoisseur, ends its days in a bewilderment of
bric-à-brac and Brummagem!</p>

<p>"Taste" has long been confounded with capacity, and accepted as
sufficient qualification for the utterance of judgment in music,
poetry, and painting. Art is joyously received as a matter of opinion;
and that it should be based upon laws as rigid and defined as those of
the known sciences, is a supposition no longer to be tolerated by
modern cultivation. For whereas no polished member of society is at
all affected at admitting himself neither engineer, mathematician, nor
astronomer, and therefore remains willingly discreet and taciturn upon
these subjects, still would he be highly offended were he supposed to
have no voice in what is clearly to him a matter of "Taste"; and so he
becomes of necessity the backer of the critic&mdash;the cause and result of
his own ignorance and vanity! The fascination of this pose is too much
for him, and he hails with delight its justification. Modesty and good
sense are revolted at nothing, and the millennium of "Taste" sets in.</p>

<p>The whole scheme is simple: the galleries are to be thrown open on
Sundays, and the public, dragged from their beer to the British
Museum, are to delight in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page033" name="page033"></a>(p. 033)</span> the Elgin Marbles, and appreciate
what the early Italians have done to elevate their thirsty souls! An
inroad into the laboratory would be looked upon as an intrusion; but
before the triumphs of Art, the expounder is at his ease, and points
out the doctrine that Raphael's results are within the reach of any
beholder, provided he enrol himself with Ruskin or hearken to Colvin
in the provinces. The people are to be educated upon the broad basis
of "Taste," forsooth, and it matters but little what "gentleman and
scholar" undertake the task.</p>

<p>Eloquence alone shall guide them&mdash;and the readiest writer or wordiest
talker is perforce their professor.</p>

<p>The Observatory at Greenwich under the direction of an Apothecary! The
College of Physicians with Tennyson as President! and we know that
madness is about. But a school of art with an accomplished
<span class="italic">littérateur</span> at its head disturbs no one! and is actually what the
world receives as rational, while Ruskin writes for pupils, and Colvin
holds forth at Cambridge.</p>

<p>Still, quite alone stands Ruskin, whose writing is art, and whose art
is unworthy his writing. To him and his example do we owe the outrage
of proffered assistance from the unscientific&mdash;the meddling of the
immodest&mdash;the intrusion of the garrulous. Art, that for ages has hewn
its own history in marble, and written <span class="pagenum"><a id="page034" name="page034"></a>(p. 034)</span> its own comments on
canvas, shall it suddenly stand still, and stammer, and wait for
wisdom from the passer-by?&mdash;for guidance from the hand that holds
neither brush nor chisel? Out upon the shallow conceit! What greater
sarcasm can Mr. Ruskin pass upon himself than that he preaches to
young men what he cannot perform! Why, unsatisfied with his own
conscious power, should he choose to become the type of incompetence
by talking for forty years of what he has never done!</p>

<p>Let him resign his present professorship, to fill the chair of Ethics
at the university. As master of English literature, he has a right to
his laurels, while, as the populariser of pictures he remains the
Peter Parley of painting.</p>

<p>"Sans rancune," by all means, my dear Whistler; but you should not
have quoted from my article, of June 6th, 1874,
<span class="sidenoteright">Mr. Tom Taylor's acknowledgment of
              presentation copy of Mr. Whistler's "Art and Art

              the author.</span>
on Velasquez, in such
a way as to give exactly the opposite impression to that which the
article, taken as a whole, conveys.</p>

<p>I appreciate and admire Velasquez as entirely, and allow me to say, as
intelligently, as yourself. I have probably seen and studied more of
his work than you have. And I maintain that the article you have
garbled in your quotation gives a fair and adequate account of the

picture it deals with&mdash;"<span class="italic">Las Meninas</span>"&mdash;and one which any artist who
knows the picture would, in essentials, subscribe to.</p>

<p>God help the artists if ever the criticism of pictures falls into the
hands of painters! It would be a case of vivisection all round.</p>

<p>Your pamphlet is a very natural result of your late disagreeable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page036" name="page036"></a>(p. 036)</span> legal experiences, though not a very wise one.</p>

<p>If the critics are not better qualified to deal with the painters than
the painter in your pamphlet shows himself qualified to deal with the
critics, it will be a bad day for art when the hands that have been
trained to the brush lay it aside for the pen.[19]

<span class="sidenoteright" title="Footnote 19"><span class="tiny">[19]</span>!?</span></p>

<h3 class="italic">"Balaam's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page041" name="page041"></a>(p. 041)</span> Ass"</h3>

<p>Mr. Whistler has written a discord in black and white. It is a strong
saying, excellent in diction, broadly and boldly set down in slashing
words....</p>

<p class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, Jan 11, 1879.</p>

<p>The point Mr. Whistler raises and enforces is that criticism of
painting other than by painters is monstrous, and not to be
tolerated.... Mr. Ruskin's "high sounding empty things" would, he
says, "give Titian the same shock of surprise that was Balaam's when
the first great critic proffered his opinion." ... The inference ...
is that all the world, competent and incompetent together, must
receive the painter's work in silence, under pain of being classed
with Balaam's ass....</p>

<p>If, finding himself ill received or ill understood, he has to say,
"You cannot understand me," he must also say, "I did not understand
myself and you, to whom I speak, sufficiently well to make you
understand me."</p>

<p>There could be no better illustration of all this than that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page042" name="page042"></a>(p. 042)</span>
Mr. Whistler has suggested of Balaam's ass. <span class="italic">For the Ass was right</span>,
although, nay, because he was an ass. "What have I done unto thee,"
said he, "that thou hast smitten me these three times?" "Because thou
hast mocked me," replies Balaam&mdash;Whistler; whereupon the Angel of the
Lord rebukes him and says, "<span class="italic">The ass saw me</span>," so that Balaam is
constrained to bow his head and fall flat on his face. And thus indeed
it is. The ass sees the Angel of the Lord there where the wise prophet
sees nothing, and, by her seeing, saves the life of the very master
who, for reward, smites her grievously and wishes he had a sword that
he might kill her.</p>

<p>Let Balaam not forget that after all he rides upon the ass, that she
has served him well ever since she was his until this day, and that
even now he is on his way with her to be promoted unto very great
honour by the Princes of Balak. And let him remember that whatever can
speak may at any moment have a word to say to him which it were best
he should hear.</p>

<p>In the "Symphony in White No. III." by Mr. Whistler there are many
dainty varieties of tint, but it is not precisely a symphony in white.

One lady has a yellowish dress and brown hair and a bit of blue
ribbon, the other has a red fan, and there are flowers and green
leaves. There is a girl in white on a white sofa, but even this girl
has reddish hair; and of course there is the flesh colour of the
complexions.</p>

<h3 class="italic">The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page045" name="page045"></a>(p. 045)</span> Critic's Mind Considered</h3>

<p>How pleasing that such profound prattle should inevitably find its
place in print! "Not precisely a symphony in white ... for there is a
yellowish dress ... brown hair, etc.... another with reddish hair ...
and of course there is the flesh colour of the complexions."</p>

<p><span class="italic">Bon Dieu!</span> did this wise person expect white hair and chalked faces?
And does he then, in his astounding consequence, believe that a
symphony in F contains no other note, but shall be a continued
repetition of F, F, F.?... Fool!</p>

<p class="right"><span class="italic">TO THE EDITOR OF THE "HOUR."</span></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I have read the intelligent remarks of your critic upon my
pictures, and am happy to be able to remove, I think, the "melancholy"
impression left upon his mind by the supposition that "the best works
are not of recent date." Permit me to reassure him, for the paintings
he speaks of in glowing terms&mdash;notably "the full-length portrait of a
young girl," which he overwhelms me by comparing to Velasquez, as well
as the two life-size portraits in black, "in which there is an almost
entire negation of colour" (though I, who am, he says, a colourist,
did not know it)&mdash;are my latest works, and but just completed.</p>

<p>May I still farther correct a misconception? The etchings and
dry-points in the gallery do not form a complete set. There are only
fifty exhibited, making about half the number I have executed.</p>

<p>Again, it was from no feeling that "my works were not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page048" name="page048"></a>(p. 048)</span> seen
to advantage when placed in juxtaposition with those of an essentially
different kind," that I "determined to have an exhibition of my own,
where no discordant elements should distract the spectator's
attention." It is true that occasionally it has been borne in upon my
mind that those whose "works are of an essentially different kind,"
are unwilling to place mine in juxtaposition with their own.</p>

<p>My wish has been, though, to prove that the place in which works of
art are shown may be made as free from "discordant elements which
distract the spectators' attention" as the works themselves.</p>

<p>Marvelling greatly that the "principle" that has led me (in his eyes
at least) to paint so that he speaks of me in the same breath with
Velasquez, should be "founded on fallacy,"&mdash;I remain, sir, your
obedient servant,</p>

<p>At the Gallery of the Fine Art Society in New Bond Street, an
exhibition has been opened of the etchings of Venice, executed by Mr.
Whistler.

<span class="sidenoteleft"><span class="italic">The World</span>, Dec. 8, 1880.</span>

Exhibitions are sometimes of slender constitution nowadays.
Mr. Whistler's etchings are twelve in number, of unimportant
dimensions, and of the slightest workmanship. They convey a certain
sense of distance and atmosphere, otherwise it cannot be said that
they are of particular value or originality. They rather resemble
vague first intentions, or memoranda for future use, than designs
completely carried out. Probably every artist coming from Venice
brings with him some such outlines as these in his sketch-books.
Apparently, so far as his twelve etchings are to be considered as
evidence in the matter, Venice has not deeply stirred either Mr.
Whistler or his art.</p>

<h3 class="italic">A <span class="pagenum"><a id="page051" name="page051"></a>(p. 051)</span> Proposal</h3>

<p>Atlas, <span class="italic">mon bon, méfiez-vous de vos gens!</span> Your art gentleman says
that Mr. Whistler exhibits twelve etchings,

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">The World</span>, Dec. 29, 1880.</span>

"slight in execution and
unimportant in size." Now the private assassin you keep, for us, need
not be hampered by mere connoisseurship in the perpetration of his
duty&mdash;therefore, <span class="italic">passe</span>, for the execution&mdash;but he should not
compromise his master's reputation for brilliancy, and print things
that he who runs may scoff at.</p>

<p>Seriously, then, my Atlas, an etching does not depend, for its
importance, upon its size. "I am not arguing with you&mdash;I am telling
you." As well speak of one of your own charming <span class="italic">mots</span> as unimportant
in length!</p>

<p>Look to it, Atlas. Be severe with your man. Tell him his "job" should
be "neatly done." I could cut my own throat better; and if need be, in
case of his dismissal, I offer my services.</p>

<p>The exhibition of etchings at the Hanover Gallery has been the
occasion of one of those squabbles which amuse everybody&mdash;perhaps,
even including the quarrellers themselves. Some etchings, exceedingly
like Mr. Whistler's in manner,

<span class="sidenoteleft">"A Storm in an Æsthetic Teapot."<br>
<span class="italic">The Cuckoo</span>, April 11, 1881.</span>

but signed "Frank Duveneck," were sent
to the Painter-Etchers' Exhibition from Venice. The Painter-Etchers
appear to have suspected for a moment that the works were really Mr.
Whistler's; and, not desiring to be the victims of an easy hoax on the
part of that gentleman, three of their members&mdash;Dr. Seymour Haden, Dr.
Hamilton, and Mr. Legros&mdash;went to the Fine Art Society's Gallery, in
New Bond Street, and asked one of the assistants there to show them
some of Mr. Whistler's Venetian plates. From this assistant they
learned that Mr. Whistler was under an arrangement to exhibit and sell
his Venetian etchings only at the Fine Art Society's Gallery; but,
even if these Painter-Etchers really <span class="pagenum"><a id="page053" name="page053"></a>(p. 053)</span> believed that "Frank
Duveneck" was only another name for James Whistler, this information
about the Fine Art Society's arrangement with him need not have shaken
that belief, for the <span class="italic">nom de plume</span> might easily have been adopted
with the concurrence of the society's leading spirits. Nor is it
altogether certain that the Painter-Etchers did anything more than
compare, for their own satisfaction as connoisseurs, the works of Mr.
Whistler and "Frank Duveneck." The motive of their doing so may have
been misunderstood by the Fine Art Society's assistant with whom they
conferred.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, this assistant thought fit to repeat to Mr.
Whistler what had passed, and also his own impressions as to the
motive of the comparison and the inquiries which the Painter-Etchers
had instituted. Whereupon Mr. Whistler has addressed a letter to Mr.
Seymour Haden (who is, by the way, <span class="italic">his brother-in-law</span>), of which all
that need be here said, is that it is extremely characteristic of Mr.
Whistler.</p>

<h3 class="italic">Later</h3> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page054" name="page054"></a>(p. 054)</span>

<p>Some time ago I referred to a storm in an "æsthetic tea-pot" that was
brewed and had burst in the Fine Art Society's Gallery,

<span class="sidenoteleft"><span class="italic">The Cuckoo</span>, April 30, 1881.</span>

in Bond
Street, in <span class="italic">re</span> Mr. Whistler's Venice Etchings. It seems to me that
Mr. Seymour Haden, Mr. Legros, and Mr. Hamilton stumbled on an
artistic mare's nest, that they rashly suggested that Mr. Whistler had
been guilty of gross misfeasance in publishing etchings in an assumed
name, and that they are now trying to get out of the scrape as best
they may. This is, however, simply an opinion formed on perusal of the
following documents, which I here present to my readers to judge of:</p>

<p>The following paragraph was some time ago sent to me with this
letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>"If the Editor of the '<span class="italic">Cuckoo</span>' should see his way to the
     publication of the accompanying paragraph as it stands, twenty
     copies may be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page055" name="page055"></a>(p. 055)</span> sent, for circulation among the Council
     of the Society of Painter-Etchers, to Mr. Piker, newsvendor,
     Shepherd's Market."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Whistler and the Painter-Etchers.</span>&mdash;Our explanation of this
     'Storm in a Tea-pot' turns out to have been in the main correct.
     It appears that not only were the three gentlemen who went to the
     Fine Art Society's Gallery to look at Mr. Whistler's etchings
     guiltless of offence, but that the object of their going there
     was actually less to show that Mr. Whistler <span class="italic">was</span> than that he
     was <span class="italic">not</span> the author of the etchings which for a moment had
     puzzled them.</p>

<p>"For this, indeed, they seem to have given each other&mdash;in the
     presence of the blundering assistant, of course&mdash;three very
     distinct reasons.</p>

<p>"Firstly, that, as already stated, Mr. Seymour Haden had quite
     seriously written to Mr. Duveneck to buy the etchings.</p>

<p>"Secondly, that they at once accepted as satisfactory and
     sufficient the explanation given them of Mr. Whistler's
     obligations to the Fine Art Society; and, thirdly, though this
     count appears to have somehow slipped altogether out of the
     indictment&mdash;they were one and all of opinion that, taken all
     round, the Duveneck etchings were the <span class="italic">best of the two (sic)</span>!!!</p>

<p>"It is a pity a clever man like Mr. Whistler is yet not clever
     enough to see that while habitual public attacks on a <span class="italic">near
     relative</span> cannot fail to be, to the majority of people,
     unpalatable, they are likely to be, when directed against a
     brother etcher, even <span class="italic">suspecte</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>I did not at the time "see my way" to publishing the paragraph "as it
stands," but, having subsequently received the following
correspondence, I think it only right to give Mr. Piker's paragraph
publicity, along with the letters subjoined:&mdash;</p>

of Venice?"</p>

the other plates were large ones, and, notably, whether Mr. Whistler
had done any other plate of the subject called 'The Riva'?"</p>

such was the case, did you request him to go with you to the Hanover

and among them the 'Riva' subject?"</p>

<p>"Did <span class="pagenum"><a id="page059" name="page059"></a>(p. 059)</span> you then incite Mr. Brown to detect, in these works, the
hand of Mr. Whistler?"</p>

<p>To the Committee of the Painter-Etchers' Society:</p>

<p>Gentlemen,&mdash;I have hitherto, in vain, written to Sir William Drake, as
secretary of the Painter-Etchers' Society,

<span class="sidenoteright">Letter to the Committee of "Painter-Etchers'
              Society."</span>

and feeling convinced that
his elaborate silence cannot possibly be the expression of any
intended discourtesy on the part of the Committee, as a body, but that
it would rather indicate that they had not been consulted in the
matter at all, I now address myself to you, and beg that you will
kindly inform me whether the Committee, as represented by their
officers, endorse the late acts of their President, or whether they
intend taking any steps towards refusing to share the shame and
ridicule that have accrued from certain "proceedings" described by Mr.
Haden as a "necessary duty," in the exercise of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page062" name="page062"></a>(p. 062)</span> which he was
officially engaged in conjunction with Dr. Hamilton and M. Legros.</p>

<p>That you may clearly see how current the matter has become, I have the
honour, Gentlemen, to send you herewith, for your serious
consideration, extracts from the daily press, and thus, as you will
read, carry out myself the first intention of a certain speculative
Piker, newsvendor, Shepherd's Market, who had purposed circulating
among you "twenty copies" of the enclosed literary venture&mdash;curtailed,
it is true, to the original "Piker paragraph," and unaccompanied by
the Piker twenty-penny prospect; the printing of which may&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;have caused a wavering on the part of Piker, and have left you
deprived of his labour after all.</p>

<p>Piker offers matter with authority&mdash;and here I would point out the
<span class="italic">close proximity of Shepherd's Market to Hertford Street,
Mayfair</span>!&mdash;most suggestive is such contiguity. The newsvendor's stall
and the doctor's office within hail of each other!</p>

<p>Surely I may, without indiscretion, congratulate the President upon
Piker's English and also upon the Pecksniffian whine about the
"brother-in-law"&mdash;rather telling in its way&mdash;but shallow!
shallow!&mdash;for after all, Gentlemen, a brother-in-law is <span class="italic">not</span> a
connection calling for sentiment&mdash;in the abstract, rather <span class="pagenum"><a id="page063" name="page063"></a>(p. 063)</span> an
intruder than "a near relation"&mdash;indeed, "near relation" is mere
swagger!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the insinuation of jealousy of the "brother-etcher" is, as
Piker puts it, "<span class="italic">suspecte</span>"&mdash;very!&mdash;and modest!&mdash;and transparent!</p>

<p>To the last paper I have added the cutting from the former <span class="italic">Cuckoo</span>
(Piker's earlier effort) so that you have the occasion of perceiving
how the progressive Piker party have gained in courage&mdash;until, in
direct contradiction to their first anxiety and hesitation, we reach
the final <span class="italic">overwhelming certainty</span> of the three representative
gentlemen, whose visit to the Fine Art Society's rooms, it would <span class="italic">now</span>
appear, was absolutely to prove to the "blundering assistant" that
some etchings he had never seen, and, consequently never had
questioned;&mdash;of the very existence of which, in short, he was utterly
unconscious,&mdash;were by a Mr. Duveneck, of whom he had never heard, and
<span class="italic">not</span> by Mr. Whistler!&mdash;a fact that in his whole life he had never
been in a position to dispute&mdash;and of which <span class="italic">the three Painter-Etchers
themselves were the only people</span> who had ever had any doubt!</p>

<p>Really, they either doubted Duveneck, or they didn't doubt
Duveneck!&mdash;Now, if the Piker party didn't doubt Duveneck, who the
devil did the Piker party doubt? And why, may I ask, does Mr. Haden,
<span class="italic">two <span class="pagenum"><a id="page064" name="page064"></a>(p. 064)</span> days after</span> the disastrous blunder in Bond Street,
<span class="italic">volunteer</span> the following note of explanation to Mr. Brown, the
assistant?&mdash;</p>

<p class="add2em">(<span class="smcap">Copy.</span>)</p>

<p class="p2">It will be remembered that the little expedition to the Fine Art
Society's Gallery took place on <span class="italic">Thursday evening, the 17th</span> of March.
On Friday, the 18th, Mr. Huish wrote to Mr. Haden demanding an
explanation; and on <span class="italic">Saturday, the 19th</span>, this over-diplomatic and
criminating note was sent to Mr. Brown,&mdash;altogether unasked for, and
curiously difficult to excuse!&mdash;"Methinks, he doth protest too much!"</p>

<p>Further comment I believe to be unnecessary.</p>

<p>I refer you, Gentlemen, to my letter of March 29th, which Mr. Haden
has never been able to answer&mdash;and merely point out that, the
"blundering assistant" was the only one who did not blunder at
all&mdash;since he alone, refrained from folly, and, notwithstanding all
exhortation, steadily refused, in the presence of cunning <span class="pagenum"><a id="page065" name="page065"></a>(p. 065)</span>
connoisseurs, to mistake the work of one man for that of another.</p>

<p>May I, without impertinence, ask what really does constitute the
"Painter-Etcher" "all round," as Piker has it?&mdash;for, of these three
gentlemen who have so markedly distinguished themselves in that
character, two certainly are not painters&mdash;and one doesn't etch!</p>

in Tite Street, is now occupied by Mr. Harry Quilter,
"the excellent art critic and writer on art," or words to that effect.
This is the great man who has succeeded Mr. Tom Taylor on the <span class="italic">Times</span>,

another kind, it is not inappropriately near Mr. Hunt's work.

This is
Mr. John Ruskin, painted by Mr. Herkomer. It is difficult to
dissociate this picture, as regards the merit of its painting, from
the interest which attaches to it as being the first oil portrait we
have ever seen of our great art critic.... The picture remains a
singularly fine one, and is, in our opinion, Mr. Herkomer's best
portrait.</p>

in at the Grosvenor without guide or
compass, and cannot by mere sense of smell distinguish between oil and
water colour, he ought, like Mark Twain, "to inquire."</p>

<p>Had he asked the guardian or the fireman in the gallery, either might
have told him not to say that one of the chief interests of Mr.

<p>Mr. Whistler knows how to defend himself so perkily that it is a
pleasure to attack him. I hasten, therefore,

<span class="sidenoteleft"><span class="italic">The World</span>, Feb. 9, 1881.</span>

with joy, to submit to
you, dear Atlas, who are growing so very clever at your languages, the
following crotchets and quavers&mdash;shall I call them? for Mr. Whistler
is just now full of "notes"&mdash;in American-Italian; they are from his
delightful brown-paper catalogue. To begin with, "Santa Margharita" is
wrong; it must be either Margarita or Margherita; the other is
impossible Italian. Then who or what is "San Giovanni <span class="italic">Apostolo et
Evangelistæ</span>"? Does the sprightly and shrill McNeill mean this for
Latin? And is the "Café Orientale" intended to be French or Italian?
It has an <span class="italic">e</span> too many for French, and an <span class="italic">f</span> too few for Italian.
"Piazetta," furthermore, does duty for "Piazzetta." Finally I give up
"Campo Sta. Martin." I don't know what that can be. The Italian
Calendar has a San Martino and a Santa Martina, but Sta. Martin is
very curious. The catalogue is exceedingly short, but a few of the
names are right.</p>

<span class="italic">chéri</span>&mdash;far from me to justify spelling of my own!

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">The World</span>, Feb. 16, 1881</span>

But who could
possibly have supposed an orthographer loose! Evidently too "ung
vieulx qui a moult roulé en Palestine et aultres lieux!"</p>

<p>What it is to be prepared, though! Atlas, <span class="italic">mon pauvre ami</span>, you know
the story of the witness who, when asked how far he stood from the
spot where the deed was done, answered unhesitatingly&mdash;"Sixty-three
feet seven inches!" "How, sir," cried the prosecuting lawyer&mdash;"how can
you possibly pretend to such accuracy?" "Well," returned the man in
the box, "you see I thought some d&mdash;&mdash;d fool would be sure to ask me,
and so I measured."</p>

<p>Atlas&mdash;In spite of the Kyrle Society, I don't appeal to the middle
classes; for I read in the <span class="italic">Times</span> that 'Arry won't have me. I am
ranked with the <span class="italic">caviare</span> of his betters, and add not to the relish of
his winkles and tea.</p>

"'Arry
has taken to going to the Grosvenor;" and "ce n'est pas tout que
d'être honnête," he says, lightly paraphrasing Alfred de Musset, "il
faut être joli garçon!"</p>

<p>And so he blooms into an æsthete of his own order. To have seen him, O
my wise Atlas, was my privilege and my misery; for he stood under one
of my own "harmonies"&mdash;already with difficulty gasping its gentle
breath&mdash;himself an amazing "arrangement" in strong mustard-and-cress,
with bird's-eye belcher of Reckitt's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page073" name="page073"></a>(p. 073)</span> blue; and then and

<p>I. That in Art, it is criminal to go beyond the means used in its
exercise.</p>

<p>II. That the space to be covered should always be in proper relation
to the means used for covering it.</p>

<p class="sidenoteright">With compliments to the Committee of the
              "Hoboken" Etching Club upon the occasion of receiving an
              invitation to compete in an etching tourney whose first

<span class="floatright">
<img src="images/img033_p095.jpg" width="50" height="83" alt="Butterfly" title=""></span></p>

<p>III. That in etching, the means used, or instrument employed, being
the finest possible point, the space to be covered should be small in
proportion.</p>

<p>IV. That all attempts to overstep the limits insisted upon by such
proportion, are inartistic thoroughly, and tend to reveal the paucity
of the means used, instead of concealing the same, as required by Art
in its refinement.</p>

<p>V. That the huge plate, therefore, is an offence&mdash;its undertaking an
unbecoming display of determination and ignorance&mdash;its accomplishment
a triumph of unthinking earnestness and uncontrolled
energy&mdash;endowments of the "duffer."</p>

<p>VI. That the custom of "Remarque" emanates from the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page077" name="page077"></a>(p. 077)</span> amateur,
and reflects his foolish facility beyond the border of his picture,
thus testifying to his unscientific sense of its dignity.</p>

<p>VII. That it is odious.</p>

<p>VIII. That, indeed, there should be no margin on the proof to receive
such "Remarque."</p>

<p>IX. That the habit of margin, again, dates from the outsider, and
continues with the collector in his unreasoning
connoisseurship&mdash;taking curious pleasure in the quantity of paper.</p>

<p>X. That the picture ending where the frame begins, and, in the case of
the etching, the white mount, being inevitably, because of its colour,
the frame, the picture thus extends itself irrelevantly through the
margin to the mount.</p>

<p>XI. That wit of this kind would leave six inches of raw canvas between
the painting and its gold frame, to delight the purchaser with the
quality of the cloth.</p>

<p>James Whistler is of American extraction, and studied painting in
France. As a student he was capricious and irregular, and did not
leave the impression amongst his fellow-pupils that his future would
be in any way distinguished ... his artistic education seems to have
been mainly acquired by private

<span class="sidenoteleft">The "book on etching."</span>

and independent study....</p>

<p>Mr. Whistler seems to be aware that etchings are usually sought as
much for their rarity as their excellence, and to have determined that
his own plates shall be rare already.</p>

<p><span class="sidenoteright" title="Footnote 20"><span class="tiny">[20]</span>"If beauty were the only province of art,

<p>I have been told that, if application is made by letter to Mr.

              the sketches of an amateur; it is difficult at first

              artist.... I <span class="italic">understand Corot now</span>, and think his

<p class="right italic">TO THE EDITOR:</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;In <span class="italic">Scribner's Magazine</span> for this month there appears an article
on Mr. Seymour Haden, the eminent surgeon etcher, by a Mr. Hamerton,

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">New York Tribune</span>, Sept. 12, 1880</span>

and in this article I have stumbled upon a curious statement
concerning, strangely enough, my own affairs, offered pleasantly in
the disguise of an anecdote habitually "narrated" by the Doctor
himself, and printed effectively in inverted commas, as here shown:</p>

<p>... "A parallel anecdote is narrated by Mr. Haden: 'The most exquisite
series of plates which Whistler ever did&mdash;his sixteen Thames
subjects&mdash;were originally printed by a steel-plate printer, and so
badly that the owner thought the plates were worn out, and sold them
for a small sum in comparison to their real worth. The purchaser took
them to Goulding, the best printer of etchings in England, and it was
found that they were not only perfect, but that they produced
impressions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page082" name="page082"></a>(p. 082)</span> which had never before been approached even by
Delatre.'"</p>

<p>Putting gently aside the question of these plates being superior to
all previous or subsequent work, and dealing merely with facts, I have
to say that they were <span class="italic">not</span> "originally printed by a steel-plate
printer"; that the impressions were <span class="italic">not</span> so bad that the owner
thought the plates worn out; and, flattering as is the supposition
that they were sold for a small sum in comparison to their real worth,
I am obliged to reject even this palatable assertion, as I received
for the plates the price that I asked, knowing full well their exact
condition.</p>

<p>Instead of the "steel-plate printer," Delatre, then at his prime, had
himself printed these etchings&mdash;a fact which, amusingly enough, Mr.
Haden admits further on, in direct contradiction to his first broad
statement. Moreover, I had myself pulled proofs of them all; indeed,
one in the set of sixteen plates, a drypoint, called "The Forge" (for
by the way they were not all of the Thames), I alone printed. When the
plates left my hands they were <span class="italic">not</span> "taken to Goulding," who at that
moment had, I fancy, barely begun his career as "the best printer of
etchings in England" (and a capital printer he certainly is); and it
was <span class="italic">not</span> "found that they produced impressions never before
approached even <span class="pagenum"><a id="page083" name="page083"></a>(p. 083)</span> by Delatre"&mdash;here we have the contradiction
alluded to&mdash;no! this theatrical denouement I must also put aside with
sorrow.</p>

<p>The plates were brought out by Messrs. Ellis, who had them printed by
some one in London, whose work was certainly not to be compared to
that of Delatre, whom I should undoubtedly have recommended; so that
<span class="italic">it was only long after the sale had been completed and the plates had
ceased to be in my possession</span>, that inferior impressions were
produced.</p>

<p>The understanding on my part with those publishers was that the plates
were to be destroyed after one hundred impressions had been taken, but
very recently they reappeared, and were sold to their present
possessors, who <span class="italic">did</span> take them to Mr. Goulding. And here I am obliged
to explain away the last element of astonishment, for Mr. Goulding
naturally found the etchings in their original perfect condition
simply because I had had them steeled in their full bloom when I had
satisfied myself by my own proofs.</p>

<p>Goulding's impressions of these plates are very excellent, but to say
they were quite unapproached by Delatre is not only needless
exaggeration, but an unkindness to Mr. Goulding.</p>

<p>Surely there must be some misunderstanding between Mr. Haden and his
biographer&mdash;a misdeal of data&mdash;an <span class="pagenum"><a id="page084" name="page084"></a>(p. 084)</span> accident with the
anecdotes&mdash;because no one was more keenly alive to all relating to
these plates and their various states than Mr. Haden himself, whose
strong sense of the importance of printing was acquired while watching
the progress of these same plates, and the previous French set, as
they were proved by me and printed by Delatre, to whom I introduced
him.</p>

<p>Far from me to spoil a good story; but for the life of me I cannot see
what any sympathizing <span class="italic">raconteur</span> will regret in the destruction of
this mere jumble of statistics that Mr. Hamerton calls "Mr. Haden's
anecdote."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamerton presents his compliments to Mr. Whistler, and begs to
inform him that he has read Mr. Whistler's very unbecoming and
improper letter in the <span class="italic">New York Tribune</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamerton in his article in <span class="italic">Scribner's Monthly</span> simply quoted a
passage from one of Mr. Haden's lectures on Etching, published in
Cassell's <span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span>; consequently Mr. Hamerton did not offer
matter to his readers under any disguise whatever. Mr. Hamerton has
answered Mr. Whistler's letter in the same journal in which it
appeared.</p>

<p>It is possibly too much to expect&mdash;upon the principle of "trumps not
turning up twice"&mdash;but Mr. Whistler does hope that Mr. Hamerton's
letter to the <span class="italic">New York Tribune</span> will be as funny as his note to Mr.
Whistler, which has just been forwarded from London.</p>

<p>Pardon! Is Mr. Whistler right in supposing, from the droll little

perhaps&mdash;another "Art Critic"?</p>

<p class="right italic">TO THE EDITOR:</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;A friend in America has sent me the letter from Mr. Whistler
which refers to my article in <span class="italic">Scribner</span> on Mr. Haden's etchings. The
letter begins as follows:</p>

<p>In <span class="italic">Scribner's Magazine</span> for this month there appears an article on
Mr. Seymour Haden,

<span class="sidenoteleft"><span class="italic">New York Tribune</span>, Oct. 11, 1880.</span>

the eminent surgeon etcher by a Mr. Hamerton, and
in this article I have stumbled upon a curious statement
concerning&mdash;strangely enough&mdash;my own affairs, offered pleasantly in
the disguise of an anecdote habitually 'narrated' by the Doctor
himself, and printed effectively in inverted commas, as here shown.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Whistler accuses me of disguising something which I chose to
tell, as if it came from Mr. Haden, by printing it in inverted commas.
The statement is "offered pleasantly in the disguise of an anecdote,"
and "printed effectively in inverted commas." <span class="pagenum"><a id="page089" name="page089"></a>(p. 089)</span> I used
inverted commas because it is the custom to do so when making a
quotation. I quoted Mr. Haden's own words from one of his lectures on
etching, and they will be found printed, as I quoted them, in
Cassell's <span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span>. I beg to be permitted to observe that a
writer who quotes a passage, as I did, in perfect good faith, ought
not to be accused of offering matter in disguise. There was no
disguise about it. Mr. Haden's words may be compared with my
quotation. Again, to prevent any possible inaccuracy, a proof of the
article in <span class="italic">Scribner</span> was sent to Mr. Haden before it was
published.[22]

<span class="sidenoteleft"><span class="italic">The Academy</span>, Feb. 24, 1883.</span>

were never meant to have
reference, and sometimes, too, by lively misquotation&mdash;as when a
writer who "did not wish to understate" Mr. Whistler's merit is made
to say he "did not wish to understand" it, Mr. Whistler has counted on
good-humouredly confounding criticism. He has entertained but not
persuaded; and if his literary efforts with the scissors and the
paste-pot might be taken with any seriousness we should have to rebuke
him for his feat. But we are far from doing so. He desired, it seems,
to say that he and Velasquez were both above criticism. An artist in
literature would have said it in fewer words; but indulgence may
fairly be granted to the less assured methods of an amateur in
authorship.</p>

in store for his friends in

<p>Delightful! Atlas&mdash;I have read here, to the idle miners&mdash;culture in

critic after demise, is a revelation, and the story of 'Arry pursued
with post-mortem, and, for Sunday demonstration, kept by galvanism
from his grave, is to them most fascinating.</p>

<p>Atlas&mdash;They have sent me the <span class="italic">Spectator</span>&mdash;a paper upon which our late
'Arry lingered to the last as art critic. In its columns I find a
correspondent calling aloud for our kind intervention. Present me,
brave Atlas, to the editor, that I may say to him:</p>

<p class="sidenoteleft"><span class="italic">The World</span>, Jan. 30, 1884.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Good sir</span>,&mdash;'Your Reviewer' is doubtless my unburied 'Arry. Why, then,
should 'his mistaking a photogravure reproduction of a pen-and-ink
drawing by Samuel Palmer for a finished etching by the same hand'
seem, 'to say the least of it, astounding'?</p>

<p>"Not at all! By this sort of thing was he known among us, poor
chap&mdash;and so was he our fresh gladness and continued surprise."</p>

<p>"Did I not make historical his enchanting encounter with Mr.
Herkomer's water-colour drawing of Mr. Ruskin at the Grosvenor, which
he described as the 'first oil portrait we have of the great master'?
Amazing that, if you like!</p>

<p>"Do <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span> not all remember how we leaped for joy at the reading of
it?"</p>

<p>"Even Atlas himself laughed aloud, and, handicapped as he is with the
World, and weighted with wisdom, danced upon his plinth, a slow
measure of reckless acquiescence, as I set down in the chronicles of
all time that 'Arry, 'unable, by mere sense of smell, to distinguish
between oil and water-colour, might at least have inquired; and that
either the fireman or the guardian in the Gallery could have told him
not to blunder in the <span class="italic">Times</span>.'"</p>

<p>"But no, he never would ask&mdash;he liked his potshots at things; it used
to give a sort of sporting interest to his speculations upon pictures.
And so he was ever obstinate&mdash;or any one at the Fine Art Society would
have told him the difference between an etching and a photograph.&mdash;I
am, good sir, yours, etc."</p>

<p>A picture is finished when all trace of the means used to bring about
the end has disappeared.</p>

<p>To say of a picture, as is often said in its praise, that it shows
great and earnest labour, is to say that it is incomplete and unfit
for view.</p>

<p>Industry in Art is a necessity&mdash;not a virtue&mdash;and any evidence of the
same, in the production, is a blemish, not a quality; a proof, not of
achievement, but of absolutely insufficient work, for work alone will
efface the footsteps of work.</p>

<p>The work of the master reeks not of the sweat of the brow&mdash;suggests no
effort&mdash;and is finished from its beginning.</p>

out with Providence in his vain effort to reconcile such joyous
reputation with the dank and hopeless appearance of this "model

<p class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">The World</span>, May 22, 1878.</p>

<p>Why should not I call my works "symphonies," "arrangements,"
"harmonies," and "nocturnes"? I know that many good people think my
nomenclature funny and myself "eccentric." Yes, "eccentric" is the
adjective they find for me.</p>

<p>The vast majority of English folk cannot and will not consider a
picture as a picture, apart from any story which it may be supposed to
tell.</p>

<p>My picture of a "Harmony in Grey and Gold" is an illustration of my
meaning&mdash;a snow scene with a single black figure and a lighted tavern.
I care nothing for the past, present, or future of the black figure,
placed there because the black was wanted at that spot. All that I
know is that my combination of grey and gold is the basis of the
picture. Now this is precisely what my friends cannot grasp.</p>

<p>They say, "Why not call it 'Trotty Veck,' and sell it for a round
harmony of golden guineas?"&mdash;naïvely acknowledging that, without
baptism, there is no ... market!</p>

<p>But <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>(p. 127)</span> even commercially this stocking of your shop with the
goods of another would be indecent&mdash;custom alone has made it
dignified. Not even the popularity of Dickens should be invoked to
lend an adventitious aid to art of another kind from his. I should
hold it a vulgar and meretricious trick to excite people about Trotty
Veck when, if they really could care for pictorial art at all, they
would know that the picture should have its own merit, and not depend
upon dramatic, or legendary, or local interest.</p>

<p>As music is the poetry of sound, so is painting the poetry of sight,
and the subject-matter has nothing to do with harmony of sound or of
colour.</p>

<p>The great musicians knew this. Beethoven and the rest wrote
music&mdash;simply music; symphony in this key, concerto or sonata in that.</p>

<p>On F or G they constructed celestial harmonies&mdash;as harmonies&mdash;as
combinations, evolved from the chords of F or G and their minor
correlatives.</p>

<p>This is pure music as distinguished from airs&mdash;commonplace and vulgar
in themselves, but interesting from their associations, as, for
instance, "Yankee Doodle," or "Partant pour la Syrie."</p>

<p>Art should be independent of all clap-trap&mdash;should stand alone, and
appeal to the artistic sense of eye or ear, without confounding this
with emotions entirely foreign to it, as devotion, pity, love,
patriotism, and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>(p. 128)</span> like. All these have no kind of concern
with it; and that is why I insist on calling my works "arrangements"
and "harmonies."</p>

<p>Take the picture of my mother, exhibited at the Royal Academy as an
"Arrangement in Grey and Black." Now that is what it is. To me it is
interesting as a picture of my mother; but what can or ought the
public to care about the identity of the portrait?</p>

<p>The imitator is a poor kind of creature. If the man who paints only
the tree, or flower, or other surface he sees before him were an
artist, the king of artists would be the photographer. It is for the
artist to do something beyond this: in portrait painting to put on
canvas something more than the face the model wears for that one day;
to paint the man, in short, as well as his features; in arrangement of
colours to treat a flower as his key, not as his model.</p>

<p>This is now understood indifferently well&mdash;at least by dressmakers. In
every costume you see attention is paid to the key-note of colour
which runs through the composition, as the chant of the Anabaptists
through the <span class="italic">Prophète</span>, or the Huguenots' hymn in the opera of that
name.</p>

<p>It is with great hesitation and much misgiving that I appear before
you, in the character of The Preacher.</p>

<p>If timidity be at all allied to the virtue modesty, and can find
favour in your eyes, I pray you, for the sake of that virtue, accord
me your utmost indulgence.</p>

<p>I would plead for my want of habit, did it not seem preposterous,
judging from precedent, that aught save the most efficient effrontery
could be ever expected in connection with my subject&mdash;for I will not
conceal from you that I mean to talk about Art. Yes, Art&mdash;that has of
late become, as far as much discussion and writing can make it, a sort
of common topic for the tea-table.</p>

<p>Art is upon the Town!&mdash;to be chucked under the chin by the passing
gallant&mdash;to be enticed within the gates of the householder&mdash;to be
coaxed into company, as a proof of culture and refinement.</p>

<p>If <span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>(p. 136)</span> familiarity can breed contempt, certainly Art&mdash;or what is
currently taken for it&mdash;has been brought to its lowest stage of
intimacy.</p>

<p>The people have been harassed with Art in every guise, and vexed with
many methods as to its endurance. They have been told how they shall
love Art, and live with it. Their homes have been invaded, their walls
covered with paper, their very dress taken to task&mdash;until, roused at
last, bewildered and filled with the doubts and discomforts of
senseless suggestion, they resent such intrusion, and cast forth the
false prophets, who have brought the very name of the beautiful into
disrepute, and derision upon themselves.</p>

<p>Alas! ladies and gentlemen, Art has been maligned. She has naught in
common with such practices. She is a goddess of dainty
thought&mdash;reticent of habit, abjuring all obtrusiveness, purposing in
no way to better others.</p>

<p>She is, withal, selfishly occupied with her own perfection
only&mdash;having no desire to teach&mdash;seeking and finding the beautiful in
all conditions and in all times, as did her high priest Rembrandt,
when he saw picturesque grandeur and noble dignity in the Jews'
quarter of Amsterdam, and lamented not that its inhabitants were not
Greeks.</p>

<p>As <span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>(p. 137)</span> did Tintoret and Paul Veronese, among the Venetians, while
not halting to change the brocaded silks for the classic draperies of
Athens.</p>

<p>As did, at the Court of Philip, Velasquez, whose Infantas, clad in
inæsthetic hoops, are, as works of Art, of the same quality as the
Elgin marbles.</p>

<p>No reformers were these great men&mdash;no improvers of the way of others!
Their productions alone were their occupation, and, filled with the
poetry of their science, they required not to alter their
surroundings&mdash;for, as the laws of their Art were revealed to them they
saw, in the development of their work, that real beauty which, to
them, was as much a matter of certainty and triumph as is to the
astronomer the verification of the result, foreseen with the light
given to him alone. In all this, their world was completely severed
from that of their fellow-creatures with whom sentiment is mistaken
for poetry; and for whom there is no perfect work that shall not be
explained by the benefit conferred upon themselves.</p>

<p>Humanity takes the place of Art, and God's creations are excused by
their usefulness. Beauty is confounded with virtue, and, before a work
of Art, it is asked: "What good shall it do?"</p>

<p>Hence it is that nobility of action, in this life, is hopelessly
linked with the merit of the work that portrays <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>(p. 138)</span> it; and thus
the people have acquired the habit of looking, as who should say, not
<span class="italic">at</span> a picture, but <span class="italic">through</span> it, at some human fact, that shall, or
shall not, from a social point of view, better their mental or moral
state. So we have come to hear of the painting that elevates, and of
the duty of the painter&mdash;of the picture that is full of thought, and
of the panel that merely decorates.</p>

<p class="p2">A favourite faith, dear to those who teach, is that certain periods
were especially artistic, and that nations, readily named, were
notably lovers of Art.</p>

<p>So we are told that the Greeks were, as a people, worshippers of the
beautiful, and that in the fifteenth century Art was engrained in the
multitude.</p>

<p>That the great masters lived in common understanding with their
patrons&mdash;that the early Italians were artists&mdash;all&mdash;and that the
demand for the lovely thing produced it.</p>

<p>That we, of to-day, in gross contrast to this Arcadian purity, call
for the ungainly, and obtain the ugly.</p>

<p>That, could we but change our habits and climate&mdash;were we willing to
wander in groves&mdash;could we be roasted <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>(p. 139)</span> out of
broadcloth&mdash;were we to do without haste, and journey without speed, we
should again <span class="italic">require</span> the spoon of Queen Anne, and pick at our peas
with the fork of two prongs. And so, for the flock, little hamlets
grow near Hammersmith, and the steam horse is scorned.</p>

<p>Useless! quite hopeless and false is the effort!&mdash;built upon fable,
and all because "a wise man has uttered a vain thing and filled his
belly with the East wind."</p>

<p>Listen! There never was an artistic period.</p>

<p>There never was an Art-loving nation.</p>

<p>In the beginning, man went forth each day&mdash;some to do battle, some to
the chase; others, again, to dig and to delve in the field&mdash;all that
they might gain and live, or lose and die. Until there was found among
them one, differing from the rest, whose pursuits attracted him not,
and so he stayed by the tents with the women, and traced strange
devices with a burnt stick upon a gourd.</p>

<p>This man, who took no joy in the ways of his brethren&mdash;who cared not
for conquest, and fretted in the field&mdash;this designer of quaint
patterns&mdash;this deviser of the beautiful&mdash;who perceived in Nature about
him curious curvings, as faces are seen in the fire&mdash;this dreamer
apart, was the first artist.</p>

<p>And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>(p. 140)</span> when, from the field and from afar, there came back the
people, they took the gourd&mdash;and drank from out of it.</p>

<p>And presently there came to this man another&mdash;and, in time, others&mdash;of
like nature, chosen by the Gods&mdash;and so they worked together; and soon
they fashioned, from the moistened earth, forms resembling the gourd.
And with the power of creation, the heirloom of the artist, presently
they went beyond the slovenly suggestion of Nature, and the first vase
was born, in beautiful proportion.</p>

<p>And the toilers tilled, and were athirst; and the heroes returned from
fresh victories, to rejoice and to feast; and all drank alike from the
artists' goblets, fashioned cunningly, taking no note the while of the
craftsman's pride, and understanding not his glory in his work;
drinking at the cup, not from choice, not from a consciousness that it
was beautiful, but because, forsooth, there was none other!</p>

<p>And time, with more state, brought more capacity for luxury, and it
became well that men should dwell in large houses, and rest upon
couches, and eat at tables; whereupon the artist, with his artificers,
built palaces, and filled them with furniture, beautiful in proportion
and lovely to look upon.</p>

<p>And the people lived in marvels of art&mdash;and ate and drank <span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>(p. 141)</span>
out of masterpieces&mdash;for there was nothing else to eat and to drink
out of, and no bad building to live in; no article of daily life, of
luxury, or of necessity, that had not been handed down from the design
of the master, and made by his workmen.</p>

<p>And the people questioned not, <span class="italic">and had nothing to say in the matter</span>.</p>

<p>So Greece was in its splendour, and Art reigned supreme&mdash;by force of
fact, not by election&mdash;and there was no meddling from the outsider.
The mighty warrior would no more have ventured to offer a design for
the temple of Pallas Athene than would the sacred poet have proffered
a plan for constructing the catapult.</p>

<p>And the Amateur was unknown&mdash;and the Dilettante undreamed of!</p>

<p>And history wrote on, and conquest accompanied civilisation, and Art
spread, or rather its products were carried by the victors among the
vanquished from one country to another. And the customs of cultivation
covered the face of the earth, so that all peoples continued to use
what <span class="italic">the artist alone produced</span>.</p>

<p>And centuries passed in this using, and the world was flooded with all
that was beautiful, until there arose <span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span> a new class, who
discovered the cheap, and foresaw fortune in the facture of the sham.</p>

<p>Then sprang into existence the tawdry, the common, the gewgaw.</p>

<p>The taste of the tradesman supplanted the science of the artist, and
what was born of the million went back to them, and charmed them, for
it was after their own heart; and the great and the small, the
statesman and the slave, took to themselves the abomination that was
tendered, and preferred it&mdash;and have lived with it ever since!</p>

<p>And the artist's occupation was gone, and the manufacturer and the
huckster took his place.</p>

<p>And now the heroes filled from the jugs and drank from the bowls&mdash;with
understanding&mdash;noting the glare of their new bravery, and taking pride
in its worth.</p>

<p>And the people&mdash;this time&mdash;had much to say in the matter&mdash;and all were
satisfied. And Birmingham and Manchester arose in their might&mdash;and Art
was relegated to the curiosity shop.</p>

<p class="p2">Nature contains the elements, in colour and form, of all pictures, as
the keyboard contains the notes of all music.</p>

<p>But <span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>(p. 143)</span> the artist is born to pick, and choose, and group with
science, these elements, that the result may be beautiful&mdash;as the
musician gathers his notes, and forms his chords, until he bring forth
from chaos glorious harmony.</p>

<p>To say to the painter, that Nature is to be taken as she is, is to say
to the player, that he may sit on the piano.</p>

<p>That Nature is always right, is an assertion, artistically, as untrue,
as it is one whose truth is universally taken for granted. Nature is
very rarely right, to such an extent even, that it might almost be
said that Nature is usually wrong: that is to say, the condition of
things that shall bring about the perfection of harmony worthy a
picture is rare, and not common at all.</p>

<p>This would seem, to even the most intelligent, a doctrine almost
blasphemous. So incorporated with our education has the supposed
aphorism become, that its belief is held to be part of our moral
being, and the words themselves have, in our ear, the ring of
religion. Still, seldom does Nature succeed in producing a picture.</p>

<p>The sun blares, the wind blows from the east, the sky is bereft of
cloud, and without, all is of iron. The windows of the Crystal Palace
are seen from all <span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>(p. 144)</span> points of London. The holiday-maker
rejoices in the glorious day, and the painter turns aside to shut his
eyes.</p>

<p>How little this is understood, and how dutifully the casual in Nature
is accepted as sublime, may be gathered from the unlimited admiration
daily produced by a very foolish sunset.</p>

<p>The dignity of the snow-capped mountain is lost in distinctness, but
the joy of the tourist is to recognise the traveller on the top. The
desire to see, for the sake of seeing, is, with the mass, alone the
one to be gratified, hence the delight in detail.</p>

<p>And when the evening mist clothes the riverside with poetry, as with a
veil, and the poor buildings lose themselves in the dim sky, and the
tall chimneys become campanili, and the warehouses are palaces in the
night, and the whole city hangs in the heavens, and fairyland is
before us&mdash;then the wayfarer hastens home; the working man and the
cultured one, the wise man and the one of pleasure, cease to
understand, as they have ceased to see, and Nature, who, for once, has
sung in tune, sings her exquisite song to the artist alone, her son
and her master&mdash;her son in that he loves her, her master in that he
knows her.</p>

<p>To him her secrets are unfolded, to him her lessons have <span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>(p. 145)</span>
become gradually clear. He looks at her flower, not with the enlarging
lens, that he may gather facts for the botanist, but with the light of
the one who sees in her choice selection of brilliant tones and
delicate tints, suggestions of future harmonies.</p>

<p>He does not confine himself to purposeless copying, without thought,
each blade of grass, as commended by the inconsequent, but, in the
long curve of the narrow leaf, corrected by the straight tall stem, he
learns how grace is wedded to dignity, how strength enhances
sweetness, that elegance shall be the result.</p>

<p>In the citron wing of the pale butterfly, with its dainty spots of
orange, he sees before him the stately halls of fair gold, with their
slender saffron pillars, and is taught how the delicate drawing high
upon the walls shall be traced in tender tones of orpiment, and
repeated by the base in notes of graver hue.</p>

<p>In all that is dainty and lovable he finds hints for his own
combinations, and thus is Nature ever his resource and always at his
service, and to him is naught refused.</p>

<p>Through his brain, as through the last alembic, is distilled the
refined essence of that thought which began with the Gods, and which
they left him to carry out.</p>

<p>Set <span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>(p. 146)</span> apart by them to complete their works, he produces that
wondrous thing called the masterpiece, which surpasses in perfection
all that they have contrived in what is called Nature; and the Gods
stand by and marvel, and perceive how far away more beautiful is the
Venus of Melos than was their own Eve.</p>

<p class="p4">For some time past, the unattached writer has become the middleman in
this matter of Art, and his influence, while it has widened the gulf
between the people and the painter, has brought about the most
complete misunderstanding as to the aim of the picture.</p>

<p>For him a picture is more or less a hieroglyph or symbol of story.
Apart from a few technical terms, for the display of which he finds an
occasion, the work is considered absolutely from a literary point of
view; indeed, from what other can he consider it? And in his essays he
deals with it as with a novel&mdash;a history&mdash;or an anecdote. He fails
entirely and most naturally to see its excellences, or
demerits&mdash;artistic&mdash;and so degrades Art, by supposing it a method of
bringing about a literary climax.</p>

<p>It <span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>(p. 147)</span> thus, in his hands, becomes merely a means of perpetrating
something further, and its mission is made a secondary one, even as a
means is second to an end.</p>

<p>The thoughts emphasised, noble or other, are inevitably attached to
the incident, and become more or less noble, according to the
eloquence or mental quality of the writer, who looks the while, with
disdain, upon what he holds as "mere execution"&mdash;a matter belonging,
he believes, to the training of the schools, and the reward of
assiduity. So that, as he goes on with his translation from canvas to
paper, the work becomes his own. He finds poetry where he would feel
it were he himself transcribing the event, invention in the intricacy
of the <span class="italic">mise en scène</span>, and noble philosophy in some detail of
philanthropy, courage, modesty, or virtue, suggested to him by the
occurrence.</p>

<p>All this might be brought before him, and his imagination be appealed
to, by a very poor picture&mdash;indeed, I might safely say that it
generally is.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <span class="italic">painter's</span> poetry is quite lost to him&mdash;the amazing
invention that shall have put form and colour into such perfect
harmony, that exquisiteness is the result, he is without
understanding&mdash;the nobility of thought, that shall have given the
artist's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>(p. 148)</span> dignity to the whole, says to him absolutely
nothing.</p>

<p>So that his praises are published, for virtues we would blush to
possess&mdash;while the great qualities, that distinguish the one work from
the thousand, that make of the masterpiece the thing of beauty that it
is&mdash;have never been seen at all.</p>

<p>That this is so, we can make sure of, by looking back at old reviews
upon past exhibitions, and reading the flatteries lavished upon men
who have since been forgotten altogether&mdash;but, upon whose works, the
language has been exhausted, in rhapsodies&mdash;that left nothing for the
National Gallery.</p>

<p class="p2">A curious matter, in its effect upon the judgment of these gentlemen,
is the accepted vocabulary of poetic symbolism, that helps them, by
habit, in dealing with Nature: a mountain, to them, is synonymous with
height&mdash;a lake, with depth&mdash;the ocean, with vastness&mdash;the sun, with
glory.</p>

<p>So that a picture with a mountain, a lake, and an ocean&mdash;however poor
in paint&mdash;is inevitably "lofty," "vast," "infinite," and
"glorious"&mdash;on paper.</p>

<p class="p2">There are those also, sombre of mien, and wise with the wisdom of
books, who frequent museums and burrow <span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>(p. 149)</span> in crypts;
collecting&mdash;comparing&mdash;compiling&mdash;classifying&mdash;contradicting.</p>

<p>Experts these&mdash;for whom a date is an accomplishment&mdash;a hall mark,
success!</p>

<p>Careful in scrutiny are they, and conscientious of
judgment&mdash;establishing, with due weight, unimportant
reputations&mdash;discovering the picture, by the stain on the
back&mdash;testing the torso, by the leg that is missing&mdash;filling folios
with doubts on the way of that limb&mdash;disputatious and dictatorial,
concerning the birthplace of inferior persons&mdash;speculating, in much
writing, upon the great worth of bad work.</p>

<p>True clerks of the collection, they mix memoranda with ambition, and,
reducing Art to statistics, they "file" the fifteenth century, and
"pigeon-hole" the antique!</p>

<p class="p2">Then the Preacher "appointed"!</p>

<p>He stands in high places&mdash;harangues and holds forth.</p>

<p>Sage of the Universities&mdash;learned in many matters, and of much
experience in all, save his subject.</p>

<p>Exhorting&mdash;denouncing&mdash;directing.</p>

<p>Filled with wrath and earnestness.</p>

<p>Bringing powers of persuasion, and polish of language, to
prove&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>Torn <span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>(p. 150)</span> with much teaching&mdash;having naught to impart.</p>

<p>Impressive&mdash;important&mdash;shallow.</p>

<p>Defiant&mdash;distressed&mdash;desperate.</p>

<p>Crying out, and cutting himself&mdash;while the gods hear not.</p>

<p>Gentle priest of the Philistine withal, again he ambles pleasantly
from all point, and through many volumes, escaping scientific
assertion&mdash;"babbles of green fields."</p>

<p class="p4">So Art has become foolishly confounded with education&mdash;that all should
be equally qualified.</p>

<p>Whereas, while polish, refinement, culture, and breeding, are in no
way arguments for artistic result, it is also no reproach to the most
finished scholar or greatest gentleman in the land that he be
absolutely without eye for painting or ear for music&mdash;that in his
heart he prefer the popular print to the scratch of Rembrandt's
needle, or the songs of the hall to Beethoven's "C minor Symphony."</p>

<p>Let him have but the wit to say so, and not feel the admission a proof
of inferiority.</p>

<p>Art happens&mdash;no hovel is safe from it, no Prince may depend upon it,
the vastest intelligence cannot bring <span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>(p. 151)</span> it about, and puny
efforts to make it universal end in quaint comedy, and coarse farce.</p>

<p>This is as it should be&mdash;and all attempts to make it otherwise are due
to the eloquence of the ignorant, the zeal of the conceited.</p>

<p>The boundary line is clear. Far from me to propose to bridge it
over&mdash;that the pestered people be pushed across. No! I would save them
from further fatigue. I would come to their relief, and would lift
from their shoulders this incubus of Art.</p>

<p>Why, after centuries of freedom from it, and indifference to it,
should it now be thrust upon them by the blind&mdash;until wearied and
puzzled, they know no longer how they shall eat or drink&mdash;how they
shall sit or stand&mdash;or wherewithal they shall clothe
themselves&mdash;without afflicting Art.</p>

<p class="p2">But, lo! there is much talk without!</p>

<p class="p2">Triumphantly they cry, "Beware! This matter does indeed concern us. We
also have our part in all true Art!&mdash;for, remember the 'one touch of
Nature' that 'makes the whole world kin.'"</p>

<p>True, indeed. But let not the unwary jauntily suppose that Shakespeare
herewith hands him his passport to Paradise, and thus permits him
speech among <span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>(p. 152)</span> the chosen. Rather, learn that, in this very
sentence, he is condemned to remain without&mdash;to continue with the
common.</p>

<p>This one chord that vibrates with all&mdash;this "one touch of Nature" that
calls aloud to the response of each&mdash;that explains the popularity of
the "Bull" of Paul Potter&mdash;that excuses the price of Murillo's
"Conception"&mdash;this one unspoken sympathy that pervades humanity,
is&mdash;Vulgarity!</p>

<p>Vulgarity&mdash;under whose fascinating influence "the many" have elbowed
"the few," and the gentle circle of Art swarms with the intoxicated
mob of mediocrity, whose leaders prate and counsel, and call aloud,
where the Gods once spoke in whisper!</p>

<p>And now from their midst the Dilettante stalks abroad. The amateur is
loosed. The voice of the æsthete is heard in the land, and catastrophe
is upon us.</p>

<p>The meddler beckons the vengeance of the Gods, and ridicule threatens
the fair daughters of the land.</p>

<p>And there are curious converts to a weird <span class="italic">culte</span>, in which all
instinct for attractiveness&mdash;all freshness and sparkle&mdash;all woman's
winsomeness&mdash;is to give way to a strange vocation for the
unlovely&mdash;and this desecration in the name of the Graces!</p>

<p>Shall this gaunt, ill-at-ease, distressed, abashed mixture <span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>(p. 153)</span>
of <span class="italic">mauvaise honte</span> and desperate assertion call itself artistic, and
claim cousinship with the artist&mdash;who delights in the dainty, the
sharp, bright gaiety of beauty?</p>

<p>No!&mdash;a thousand times no! Here are no connections of ours.</p>

<p>We will have nothing to do with them.</p>

<p>Forced to seriousness, that emptiness may be hidden, they dare not
smile&mdash;</p>

<p>While the artist, in fulness of heart and head, is glad, and laughs
aloud, and is happy in his strength, and is merry at the pompous
pretension&mdash;the solemn silliness that surrounds him.</p>

<p>For Art and Joy go together, with bold openness, and high head, and
ready hand&mdash;fearing naught, and dreading no exposure.</p>

<p>Know, then, all beautiful women, that we are with you. Pay no heed, we
pray you, to this outcry of the unbecoming&mdash;this last plea for the
plain.</p>

<p>It concerns you not.</p>

<p>Your own instinct is near the truth&mdash;your own wit far surer guide than
the untaught ventures of thick heeled Apollos.</p>

<p>What! will you up and follow the first piper that leads you down
Petticoat Lane, there, on a Sabbath, to gather, for the week, from the
dull rags of ages <span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>(p. 154)</span> wherewith to bedeck yourselves? that,
beneath your travestied awkwardness, we have trouble to find your own
dainty selves? Oh, fie! Is the world, then, exhausted? and must we go
back because the thumb of the mountebank jerks the other way?</p>

<p>Costume is not dress.</p>

<p>And the wearers of wardrobes may not be doctors of taste!</p>

<p>For by what authority shall these be pretty masters? Look well, and
nothing have they invented&mdash;nothing put together for comeliness' sake.</p>

<p>Haphazard from their shoulders hang the garments of the
hawker&mdash;combining in their person the motley of many manners with the
medley of the mummers' closet.</p>

<p>Set up as a warning, and a finger-post of danger, they point to the
disastrous effect of Art upon the middle classes.</p>

<p class="p2">Why this lifting of the brow in deprecation of the present&mdash;this
pathos in reference to the past?</p>

<p>If Art be rare to-day, it was seldom heretofore.</p>

<p>It is false, this teaching of decay.</p>

<p>The master stands in no relation to the moment at which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>(p. 155)</span> he
occurs&mdash;a monument of isolation&mdash;hinting at sadness&mdash;having no part in
the progress of his fellow men.</p>

<p>He is also no more the product of civilisation than is the scientific
truth asserted dependent upon the wisdom of a period. The assertion
itself requires the <span class="italic">man</span> to make it. The truth was from the
beginning.</p>

<p>So Art is limited to the infinite, and beginning there cannot
progress.</p>

<p>A silent indication of its wayward independence from all extraneous
advance, is in the absolutely unchanged condition and form of
implement since the beginning of things.</p>

<p>The painter has but the same pencil&mdash;the sculptor the chisel of
centuries.</p>

<p>Colours are not more since the heavy hangings of night were first
drawn aside, and the loveliness of light revealed.</p>

<p>Neither chemist nor engineer can offer new elements of the
masterpiece.</p>

<p class="p2">False again, the fabled link between the grandeur of Art and the
glories and virtues of the State, for Art feeds not upon nations, and
peoples may be wiped from the face of the earth, but Art <span class="italic">is</span>.</p>

<p>It <span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>(p. 156)</span> is indeed high time that we cast aside the weary weight of
responsibility and co-partnership, and know that, in no way, do our
virtues minister to its worth, in no way do our vices impede its
triumph!</p>

<p>How irksome! how hopeless! how superhuman the self-imposed task of the
nation! How sublimely vain the belief that it shall live nobly or art
perish.</p>

<p>Let us reassure ourselves, at our own option is our virtue. Art we in
no way affect.</p>

<p>A whimsical goddess, and a capricious, her strong sense of joy
tolerates no dulness, and, live we never so spotlessly, still may she
turn her back upon us.</p>

<p>As, from time immemorial, she has done upon the Swiss in their
mountains.</p>

<p>What more worthy people! Whose every Alpine gap yawns with tradition,
and is stocked with noble story; yet, the perverse and scornful one
will none of it, and the sons of patriots are left with the clock that
turns the mill, and the sudden cuckoo, with difficulty restrained in
its box!</p>

<p>For this was Tell a hero! For this did Gessler die!</p>

<p>Art, the cruel jade, cares not, and hardens her heart, and hies her
off to the East, to find, among the opium-eaters of Nankin, a
favourite with whom she lingers fondly&mdash;caressing his blue porcelain,
and painting his coy <span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>(p. 157)</span> maidens, and marking his plates with
her six marks of choice&mdash;indifferent in her companionship with him, to
all save the virtue of his refinement!</p>

<p>He it is who calls her&mdash;he who holds her!</p>

<p>And again to the West, that her next lover may bring together the
Gallery at Madrid, and show to the world how the Master towers above
all; and in their intimacy they revel, he and she, in this knowledge;
and he knows the happiness untasted by other mortal.</p>

<p>She is proud of her comrade, and promises that in after-years, others
shall pass that way, and understand.</p>

<p>So in all time does this superb one cast about for the man worthy her
love&mdash;and Art seeks the Artist alone.</p>

<p>Where he is, there she appears, and remains with him&mdash;loving and
fruitful&mdash;turning never aside in moments of hope deferred&mdash;of
insult&mdash;and of ribald misunderstanding; and when he dies she sadly
takes her flight, though loitering yet in the land, from fond
association, but refusing to be consoled.[33]</p>

<p class="sidenoteright" title="Footnote 33"><span class="tiny">[33]</span>And so have we the ephemeral influence of
              the Master's memory&mdash;the afterglow, in which are warmed,
              for a while, the worker and disciple.</p>

<p>With the man, then, and not with the multitude, are her intimacies;
and in the book of her life the names inscribed are few&mdash;scant,
indeed, the list of those who have helped to write her story of love
and beauty.</p>

<p>From <span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>(p. 158)</span> the sunny morning, when, with her glorious Greek
relenting, she yielded up the secret of repeated line, as, with his
hand in hers, together they marked in marble, the measured rhyme of
lovely limb and draperies flowing in unison, to the day when she
dipped the Spaniard's brush in light and air, and made his people live
within their frames, and <span class="italic">stand upon their legs</span>, that all nobility
and sweetness, and tenderness, and magnificence should be theirs by
right, ages had gone by, and few had been her choice.</p>

<p>Countless, indeed, the horde of pretenders! But she knew them not.</p>

<p>A teeming, seething, busy mass, whose virtue was industry, and whose
industry was vice!</p>

<p>Their names go to fill the catalogue of the collection at home, of the
gallery abroad, for the delectation of the bagman and the critic.</p>

<p class="p2">Therefore have we cause to be merry!&mdash;and to cast away all
care&mdash;resolved that all is well&mdash;as it ever was&mdash;and that it is not
meet that we should be cried at, and urged to take measures!</p>

<p>Enough have we endured of dulness! Surely are we weary of weeping, and
our tears have been cozened from us falsely, for they have called out
woe! when there was no grief&mdash;and, alas! where all is fair!</p>

<p>We <span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>(p. 159)</span> have then but to wait&mdash;until, with the mark of the Gods
upon him&mdash;there come among us again the chosen&mdash;who shall continue
what has gone before. Satisfied that, even were he never to appear,
the story of the beautiful is already complete&mdash;hewn in the marbles of
the Parthenon&mdash;and broidered, with the birds, upon the fan of
Hokusai&mdash;at the foot of Fusi-yama.</p>

<p>Last night, at Prince's Hall, Mr. Whistler made his first public
appearance as a lecturer on Art.... There were some arrows ... shot
off ...

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, Feb. 21, 1885.</span>

and (O, <span class="italic">mea culpa!</span>) at dress reformers most of all.... That
an artist will find beauty in ugliness, <span class="italic">le beau dans l'horrible</span>, is
now a commonplace of the schools.... I differ entirely from Mr.
Whistler. An Artist is not an isolated fact; he is the resultant of a
certain <span class="italic">milieu</span> and a certain <span class="italic">entourage</span>, and can no more be born of
a nation that is devoid of any sense of beauty than a fig can grow
from a thorn or a rose blossom from a thistle....

<p>The <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> has not thought it disgraceful to once more
justify its title to be called the "Saturday Reviler." This time it is
not to break upon the wheel some poor butterfly of a lady traveller or
novelist, but to scoff at an aged painter of the highest repute&mdash;Mr.
Herbert&mdash;upon his retirement to the rank of "Honorary Academician,"
after a career such as few, if any, painters living can boast. This it
pleases the "Reviler" to congratulate artists upon as "good news,"
without a word or a thought of what the retiring Academician has done
in art, except to utter the contemptible untruth that "his resignation
means that he has found out that he is beaten," <span class="italic">not</span> by the natural
failing of old age, but because he failed to impress such a writer as
this with the special exhibition of the works of his long life, that
was made some few years back to mark the completion of his last great
picture for the House of Lords, "The Judgment <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>(p. 167)</span> of Daniel."
That exhibition, which most people, who know anything about painting
in its highest style of religious and monumental art, thought a most
interesting display of a painter's career, is described by this most
genial of critics as "acres of pallid purple canvases, with wizened
saints and virgins in attitudinizing groups."</p>

<p>Whether that collection of Mr. Herbert's works had merit or not is
matter of opinion which I am not concerned to dispute; but, as a
matter of fact, there were only <span class="italic">three</span> small pictures in which the
virgin or any saints appeared; the other pictures, besides the two
large works of "The Delivery of the Law" and "The Judgment of Daniel,"
painted for the nation, being historical subjects, such as the "Lear
Disinheriting Cordelia," a fresco of which is in the House of Lords;
"The Acquittal of the Seven Bishops," which the Corporation of Salford
purchased for their gallery of art; and several fine works of his
youth, such as the "Brides of Venice," a "Procession in Venice, 1528,"
and others, which won for him his election to the Academy forty-five
years ago, when he had to compete with such men as are, unfortunately,
not to be found now among the
candidates&mdash;Etty&mdash;Maclise&mdash;Dyce&mdash;Egg&mdash;and Elmore.</p>

<p>But the "<span class="italic">Saturday's</span>" art critic, if he ever saw this exhibition
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span> at all, didn't go to see these pictures. As Goethe says, "the
eye sees what it came to see," and he went to see the "acres of purple
canvases, with their wizened saints," which were not there. No
matter&mdash;it suits his purpose to declare that they were, just as it
does to cram into a paragraph more ignorance, insolence, and false
assertions combined than is often to be met with even in this locality
of literature, where the editor seems to be surrounded with all the
prigs, and the pumps, and the snobs of the literary profession.</p>

better reason than that he <span class="italic">is</span> old&mdash;and those who would point out the
wisdom and comfort of his withdrawal into the wigwam of private life,
sternly reproved and anathematized and threatened with shame&mdash;until
they might well expect to find themselves come upon by the bears of
the aged and irascible, though bald-headed, Prophet, whom the children
had thoughtfully urged to "go up."</p>

<p>Fancy the Frenchmen's astonishment as I read, and their placid
amusement as I attempted to point out that it was "meant drolly&mdash;that
<span class="italic">enfin</span> you were a <span class="italic">mystificateur</span>!"</p>

<p>Henry, why should I thus be mortified? Also, why this new <span class="italic">pose</span>, this
cheap championship of senility?</p>

<p>How, in the name of all that is incompetent, do you find much virtue
in work spreading over more time! What means this affectation of
<span class="italic">naïveté</span>?</p>

<p>We all know that work excuses itself only by reason of its quality.</p>

<p>If the work be foolish, it surely is not less foolish because an
honest and misspent lifetime has been passed in producing it.</p>

<p>What matters it that the offending worker has grown old among us, and
has endeared himself to many <span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>(p. 171)</span> by his caprices as ratepayer
and neighbour?</p>

<p>Personally, he may have claims upon his surroundings; but, as the
painter of poor pictures, he is damned for ever.</p>

<p>You see, my Henry, that it is not sufficient to be, as you are in wit
and wisdom, among us, amazing and astute; a very Daniel in your
judgment of many vexed questions; of a frankness and loyalty withal in
your crusade against abuses, that makes of the keen litigator a most
dangerous Quixote.</p>

<p>This peculiar temperament gives you that superb sense of right,
<span class="italic">outside the realms of art</span>, that amounts to genius, and carries with
it continued success and triumph in the warfare you wage.</p>

<p>But here it helps you not. And so you find yourself, for instance,
pleasantly prattling in print of "English Art."</p>

<p>Learn, then, O! Henry, that there is no such thing as English Art. You
might as well talk of English Mathematics. Art is Art, and Mathematics
is Mathematics.</p>

<p>What you call English Art, is not Art at all, but produce, of which
there is, and always has been, and always will be, a plenty, whether
the men producing it are dead and called &mdash;&mdash;, or (I refer you to your
own <span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>(p. 172)</span> selection, far be it from me to choose)&mdash;or alive and
called &mdash;&mdash;, whosoever you like as you turn over the Academy catalogue.</p>

<p>The great truth, you have to understand, is that it matters not at all
whom you prefer in this long list. They all belong to the excellent
army of mediocrity; the differences between them being infinitely
small&mdash;merely microscopic&mdash;as compared to the vast distance between
any one of them and the Great.</p>

<p>They are the commercial travellers of Art, whose works are their
wares, and whose exchange is the Academy.</p>

<p>They pass and are forgotten, or remain for a while in the memory of
the worthies who knew them, and who cling to their faith in them, as
it flatters their own place in history&mdash;famous themselves&mdash;the friends
of the famous!</p>

<p>Speak of them, if it please you, with uncovered head&mdash;even as in
France you would remove your hat as there passes by the hearse&mdash;but
remember it is from the conventional habit of awe alone, this show of
respect, and called forth generally by the casual corpse of the
commonest kind.</p>

<p class="right italic">TO THE EDITOR:</p>

<p class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">The Observer</span>, April 11, 1886.</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;In your report of the Graham sale of pictures at Messrs. Christie
and Manson's rooms, I read the following:</p>

<p>"The next work, put upon the easel, was a 'Nocturne in blue and
silver,' by J. M. Whistler. It was received with hisses."</p>

<p>May I beg, through your widely spread paper, to acknowledge the
distinguished, though I fear unconscious, compliment so publicly paid.</p>

<p>It is rare that recognition, so complete, is made during the lifetime
of the painter, and I would wish to have recorded my full sense of
this flattering exception in my favour.</p>

<p class="fig50">

<h3 class="italic" style="padding-top: 4em">A <span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>(p. 177)</span> Further Proposition</h3>

<p>The notion that I paint flesh lower in tone than it is in nature, is
entirely based upon the popular superstition as to what flesh really
is&mdash;when

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1887.</span>

seen on canvas; for the people never look at nature with any
sense of its pictorial appearance&mdash;for which reason, by the way, they
also never look at a picture with any sense of nature, but,
unconsciously from habit, with reference to what they have seen in
other pictures.</p>

<p>Now, in the usual "pictures of the year" there is but one flesh, that
shall do service under all circumstances, whether the person painted
be in the soft light of the room or out in the glare of the open. The
one aim of the unsuspecting painter is to make his man "stand out"
from the frame&mdash;never doubting that, on the contrary, he should
really, and in truth absolutely does, stand <span class="italic">within</span> the frame&mdash;and at
a depth behind it equal to the distance at which the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>(p. 178)</span> painter
sees his model. The frame is, indeed, the window through which the
painter looks at his model, and nothing could be more offensively
inartistic than this brutal attempt to thrust the model on the
hither-side of this window!</p>

<p>Yet this is the false condition of things to which all have become
accustomed, and in the stupendous effort to bring it about,
exaggeration has been exhausted&mdash;and the traditional means of the
incompetent can no further go.</p>

<p>Lights have been heightened until the white of the tube alone
remains&mdash;shadows have been deepened until black alone is left.
Scarcely a feature stays in its place, so fierce is its intention of
"firmly" coming forth; and in the midst of this unseemly struggle for
prominence, the gentle truth has but a sorry chance, falling flat and
flavourless, and without force.</p>

<p>The Master from Madrid, himself, beside this monster success of
mediocrity, would be looked upon as mild: <span class="italic">beau bien sure, mais pas
"dans le mouvement"</span>!</p>

<p>Whereas, could the people be induced to turn their eyes but for a
moment, with the fresh power of comparison, upon their
fellow-creatures as they pass in the gallery, they might be made dimly
to perceive (though I doubt it, so blind is their belief in the bad),
how <span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>(p. 179)</span> little they resemble the impudent images on the walls!
how "quiet" in colour they are! how "grey!" how "low in tone." And
then it might be explained to their riveted intelligence how they had
mistaken meretriciousness for mastery, and by what mean methods the
imposture had been practised upon them.</p>

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">The Daily News</span>, Nov. 22, 1886.</span>

"withdrawn from the Society of British Artists." This tardy statement
acquires undue significance at this moment, with a tendency to
mislead, implying, as it might, that these resignations were in
consequence of, and intended as a marked disapproval of, the
determined stand made by the Society in excluding from their coming
exhibition the masses of commonplace work hitherto offered to the
public in their galleries. No such importance attaches, however, to
their resignations, as these two gentlemen left Suffolk Street six
months ago.</p>

Reid from the ranks of that Society, and mentions in proof of his
correction that their resignation took place six months ago. He might
have gone further, and added that their secession corresponded in time
with his own election as president. It is well known to artists that
one, if not both, of these gentlemen left the Society knowing that
changes of policy, of which they could not approve, were inevitable
under the presidency of Mr. Whistler. It will be for the patrons of
the Suffolk Street Gallery to decide whether the more than
half-uncovered walls which will be offered to their view next week are
more interesting than the work of many artists of more than average
merit which will be conspicuous by its absence, owing to the selfish
policy inaugurated.</p>

<p class="right italic">TO THE EDITOR:</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;The anonymous "British Artist" says that "Mr. Whistler denies
that the recent policy of the Society of British Artists was the cause

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">The Daily News</span>, Nov. 26, 1886.</span>

of the secession of Messrs. Reid and Burr from the ranks of that
Society."</p>

<p>Far from me to propose to penetrate the motives of such withdrawal,
but what I did deny was that it could possibly be caused&mdash;as its
strangely late announcement seemed sweetly to insinuate&mdash;by the strong
determination to tolerate no longer the mediocre work that had
hitherto habitually swarmed the walls of Suffolk Street.</p>

<p>This is a plain question of date, and I pointed out that these two
gentlemen left the Society six months ago&mdash;long <span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>(p. 190)</span> before the
supervising committee were called upon to act at all, or make any
demonstration whatever. Your correspondent regrets that I do not "go
further," and straightway goes further himself, and scarcely fares
better, when, with a quaintness of <span class="italic">naïveté</span> rare at this moment, he
proposes that "it will be for the patrons of the gallery to decide
whether the more than half-uncovered walls are more interesting than
the works of many artists of more than the average merit."</p>

<p>Now it will be for the patrons to decide absolutely nothing. It is,
and will always be, for the gentlemen of the hanging committee alone,
duly chosen, to decide whether empty space be preferable to poor
pictures&mdash;whether, in short, it be their duty to cover walls, merely
that walls may be covered&mdash;no matter with what quality of work.</p>

<p>Indeed, the period of the patron has utterly passed away, and the
painter takes his place&mdash;to point out what he knows to be consistent
with the demands of his art&mdash;without deference to patrons or prejudice
to party. Beyond this, whether the "policy of Mr. Whistler and his
following" be "selfish or no," <span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>(p. 191)</span> matters but little; but if
the policy of your correspondent's "following" find itself among the
ruthlessly rejected, his letter is more readily explained.</p>

sufficiently hardened to her shameful calling, they would for ever
hold their tongues and pens in supporting the practice. Is not
clothedness a distinct type and feature of our Christian faith? All

through the innovations he has introduced.... He has several oil and
pastel pictures, very slight in themselves, of the female nude,
dignified and graceful in line and charmingly chaste, entitled
"Harmony," "Caprice," and "Note." Beneath the latter Mr. Whistler has
written, "Horsley <span class="italic">soit qui mal y pense</span>."</p>

<h3 class="italic">A <span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>(p. 199)</span> Played-out Policy</h3>

<p class="right italic"><span class="right3em">TO THE EDITOR</span><br>
OF THE "PALL MALL GAZETTE":</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;In your courageous crusade against the Demon Dulness and his
preposterous surroundings, I think it well that there should be
delivered into your hands certain documents for immediate publication,

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, Dec. 9, 1886.</span>

that your readers may be roused quickly, and hear again how well
fenced in are the foolish in strong places&mdash;and how greatly to be
desired is their exposure, discomfiture, and death&mdash;that Truth may
prevail.</p>

<p>It happened in this way. The criticism in the <span class="italic">Times</span> called for
instant expostulation, and my answer was consequently sent in to the
Editor, who forthwith returned it, regretting "that its tone prevented
its appearance in the paper." ... I thereupon withdrew to write the
following note to the Editor in person:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear Sir&mdash;Permit me to call your courteous attention to the fact that
the enclosed letter to the Editor of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>(p. 200)</span> the <span class="italic">Times</span> is in reply
to an article that appeared in your paper&mdash;and that, as I sign my name
in full, I alone am responsible for its tone or form; indeed, that
such is its tone and form, is because it is my letter.</p>

<p>"In common fairness the answer to, or comment upon, any statements
made in your paper should be published in your paper, as proper
etiquette prevents its insertion in any other journal.</p>

<p>"Also, you surely would not propose to dictate certain forms or styles
in which alone the columns of the <span class="italic">Times</span> are to be approached&mdash;as who
should say all other savour of sacrilege!&mdash;or acquiescence alone would
do, and you would have to write all your letters yourselves.</p>

<p>"My letter concerns the effect produced by criticism of a commonplace
and inferior kind, wholly unworthy the first paper in England&mdash;and I
am startled to learn, and still unwilling to believe, that the <span class="italic">Times</span>
would shun all ventilation and refuse to publish any letter as its
sole means of screening its staff or protecting its writers.</p>

<p>"I submit that the tone of my letter sins against no laws that are
accepted in antagonism&mdash;that it offends in no way the etiquette of
attack known to gentlemen.</p>

<p>"I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>(p. 201)</span> beg, therefore, again, that if there be still time for its
insertion, you will have it printed in your issue of to-morrow, or
will say that it shall appear in the <span class="italic">Times</span> of Thursday morning.</p>

<p class="p1_0 left50">"I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p0 left60">"Very faithfully,</p>
<p class="p0 right smcap">"J. McNeill Whistler."</p>

<p>I was now told, "with the Editor's compliments," "that my letter
should be considered." Taking this in complete good faith, I left the
office, to discover the next day in print a remnant of the letter in
question; that, by itself, entirely did away with sufficient reason
for its being there at all. The two ensuing notes explain themselves:</p>

<p class="right smaller">To <span class="smcap">J. McN. Whistler</span>, Esq.:</p>

<p class="smaller">"The Editor of the <span class="italic">Times</span> has inserted in to-day's paper the
     only portion of Mr. Whistler's letter of November 30 which
     appears to have any claim to publication.</p>

<p class="smaller">"<span class="smcap">Printing House Square</span>, Dec. 1, 1886."</p>

<p class="p2 smaller">"To the Editor of the <span class="italic">Times</span>:</p>

<p class="smaller">"Dear Sir&mdash;I beg to acknowledge the consummate sense of
     opportunity displayed by the Editor of the <span class="italic">Times</span>, in his
     cunning production of a part of my letter.</p>

<p class="smaller">"Amazing! <span class="italic">Mes compliments!</span>"<br>

<p style="padding-top: 3em">Without <span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>(p. 202)</span> further comment I hand you a copy of the rejected
letter.</p>

<p>"To the Editor of the <span class="italic">Times</span>.&mdash;Sir&mdash;In his article upon the
     Society of British Artists, your Art gentleman ventures the
     opinion of the 'plain man.'</p>

<p>"That such opinion is out of place and stultifying in a question
     of Art never occurs to him, and it is therefore frankly cited as,
     in a way, conclusive.</p>

<p>"The <span class="italic">naïf</span> train of thought that justified the importance
     attached to this poor 'plain' opinion at all would seem to be the
     same that pervades the writing throughout; until it becomes
     difficult to discover where the easy effrontery and
     self-sufficiency of the 'plain one,' nothing doubting, cease, and
     the wit and wisdom of the experienced expert begin&mdash;so that one
     unconsciously confounds the incautious critic with the plausible
     plain person, who finally becomes the same authority.</p>

<p>"Blind plainness certainly is the characteristic of the solemn
     censure upon the fine work of Mr. Stott, of Oldham&mdash;plain
     blindness the omission of all mention of Mr. Ludovici's dainty
     dancing-girl.</p>

<p>"Bewilderment among paintings is naturally the fate of the 'plain
     man,' but, when put forth in the <span class="italic">Times</span>, his utterances, however
     empty, acquire a semblance of sense; so that while he gravely
     descants with bald assurance <span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>(p. 203)</span> upon the engineering of
     the light in the galleries, and the decoration of the walls, the
     reader stands a chance of being misled, and may not discover at
     once that the 'plain' writer is qualified by ignorance alone to
     continue.</p>

<p>"Permit me, therefore, to rectify inconsequent impressions, and
     tell your readers that there is nothing 'tentative' in the
     'arrangement' of colour, walls, or drapery&mdash;that the battens
     should <span class="italic">not</span> 'be removed'&mdash;that they are meant to remain, not
     only for their use, but as bringing parallel lines into play that
     subdivide charmingly the lower portion of the walls and add to
     their light appearance&mdash;that the whole 'combination' is
     complete&mdash;and that the 'plain man' is, as usual, 'out of it.'&mdash;I
     am, Sir, etc.,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">J. McNeill Whistler</span>."</p>

<p class="p2">The question of fair dealing and good manners in this matter I could
not leave in better hands than your own, and I will only add that
hitherto I have always met with the utmost readiness on the part of
the press to receive into their columns any reply, however opposed to
assertions of their own.</p>

<p>Surely it is but poor policy this peremptory attempt to maintain in
authority the weak and blundering one, that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>(p. 204)</span> he may destroy
himself and bring sorrow upon his people.</p>

<p>Rather let him be thrust from his post, that he may be "brayed in a
mortar among wheat with a pestle"&mdash;that the Just be assuaged and
foolishness depart from among us.</p>

<h3 class="italic" style="padding-top: 8em">An <span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>(p. 205)</span> Interview with an ex-President</h3>

<p>The adverse vote by which the Royal Society of British Artists
transferred its oath of allegiance from Mr. Whistler is for the time

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, June 11, 1888.</span>

the chief topic of conversation in artistic circles.... We instructed
our representative to visit Mr. Whistler to obtain his explanation of
the affair.</p>

<p>"The state of affairs?" said Mr. Whistler, in his light and airy way,
raising his eyebrows and twinkling his eyes, as if it were all the
best possible fun in the world; "why, my dear sir, there's positively
<span class="italic">no</span> state of affairs at all. Contrary to public declaration, there's
actually nothing chaotic in the whole business; on the contrary,
everything is in order, and just as it should be. The survival of the
fittest as regards the presidency, don't you see, and, well&mdash;Suffolk
Street is itself again! A new government has come in, and, as I told
the members the other night, I congratulate the Society on the result
of their vote, for no longer can <span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>(p. 206)</span> it be said that the right
man is in the wrong place. No doubt their pristine sense of
undisturbed somnolence will again settle upon them after the
exasperated mental condition arising from the unnatural strain
recently put upon the old ship. Eh? what? Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"You do not then consider the Society as out of date? You do not
think, as is sometimes said, that the establishment of the Grosvenor
took away the <span class="italic">raison d'être</span> and original intention of the
Society&mdash;that of being a foil to the Royal Academy?"</p>

<p>"I can hardly say what was originally intended, but I do know that it
was originally full of hope, and even determination; shown in a manner
by their getting a Royal Charter&mdash;the only art society in London, I
believe, that has one.</p>

<p>"But by degrees it lapsed into a condition of incapacity&mdash;a sort of
secondary state,&mdash;do you see, till it acknowledged itself a species of
<span class="italic">crêche</span> for the Royal Academy. Certain it is that when I came into it
the prevalent feeling among all the men was that their best work
should go to 'another place.'</p>

<p>"I felt that this sense of inferiority was fatal to the well-being of
the place.</p>

<p>"For that reason I attempted to bring about a sense of <span class="italic">esprit de
corps</span> and ambition, which culminated in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span> what might be
called 'my first offence'&mdash;by my proposition that members belonging to
other societies should hold no official position in ours. I wanted to
make it an art centre," continued Mr. Whistler, with a sudden vigour
and an earnestness for which the public would hardly give credit to
this Master of Badinage and Apostle of Persiflage; "they wanted it to
remain a shop, although I said to them, 'Gentlemen, don't you perceive
that as shopmen you have already failed, don't you see, eh?' But they
were under the impression that the sales decreased under my methods
and my <span class="italic">régime</span>, and ignored the fact that sales had declined all over
the country from all sorts of causes, commercial, and so on.</p>

<p>Their only chance lay in the art tone of the place, for the
old-fashioned pictures had ceased to become saleable wares&mdash;buyers
simply wouldn't buy them. But members' work I <span class="italic">couldn't</span>, by the
rules, eliminate&mdash;only the bad outsiders were choked off."</p>

<p>"Then how do you explain the bitterness of all the opposition?"</p>

<p>"A question of 'pull devil, pull baker,' and the devil has gone and
the bakers remain in Suffolk Street! Ha! ha! Here is a list of the
fiendish party who protested against the thrusting forth of their
president in such an unceremonious way:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alfred <span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>(p. 208)</span> Stevens, Theodore Roussel, Nelson Maclean, Macnab,
Waldo Story, A. Ludovici, jun., Sidney Starr, Francis James, W. A.
Rixon, Aubrey Hunt, Moffatt P. Lindner, E. G. Girardot, Ludby, Arthur
Hill, Llewellyn, W. Christian Symons, C. Wyllie, A. F. Grace, J. E.
Grace, J. D. Watson, Jacomb Hood, Thornley, J. J. Shannon, and Charles
Keen. Why, the very flower of the Society! and whom have they
left&mdash;<span class="italic">bon Dieu!</span> whom have they left?"</p>

<p>"It was a hard fight then?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, they brought up the maimed, the halt, the lame, and the
blind&mdash;literally&mdash;like in Hogarth's 'Election;' they brought up
everything but corpses, don't you know!&mdash;very well!"</p>

<p>"But all this hardly explains the bitterness of the feud and personal
enmity to you."</p>

<p>"What? Don't you see? My presidential career had in a manner been a
busy one. When I took charge of the ship I found her more or less
water-logged. Well, I put the men to the pumps, and thoroughly shook
up the old vessel; had her re-rigged re-cleaned, and painted&mdash;and
finally I was graciously permitted to run up the Royal Standard to the
masthead, and brought her fully to the fore, ready for action&mdash;as
became a Royal flagship! And as a natural result mutiny at once set
in!</p>

<p>"Don't <span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>(p. 209)</span> you see," he continued, with one of his strident
laughs, "what might be considered, by the thoughtless, as benefits,
were resented, by the older and wiser of the crew, as innovations and
intrusions of an impertinent and offensive nature. But the immediate
result was that interest in the Society was undeniably developed, not
only at home, but certainly abroad. Notably in Paris all the art
circle was keenly alive to what was taking place in Suffolk Street;
and, although their interest in other institutions in this country had
previously flagged, there was the strong willingness to take part in
its exhibitions.</p>

<p>For example, there was Alfred Stevens, who showed his own sympathy
with the progressive efforts by becoming a member. And look at the
throngs of people that crowded our private views&mdash;eh? ha! ha! what!
But what will you!&mdash;the question is, after all, purely a parochial
one&mdash;and here I would stop to wonder, if I do not seem pathetic and
out of character, why the Artist is naturally an object of
vituperation to the Vestryman?&mdash;Why am <span class="italic">I</span>&mdash;who, of course, as you
know, am charming&mdash;why am I the pariah of my parish?</p>

<p>"Why should these people do other than delight in me?&mdash;Why should they
perish rather than forgive the one who had thrust upon them honour and
success?"</p>

<p>"And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>(p. 210)</span> the moral of it all?"</p>

<p>Mr. Whistler became impressive&mdash;almost imposing&mdash;as he stroked his
moustache, and tried to hide a smile behind his hand.</p>

<p>"The organisation of this 'Royal Society of British Artists' as shown
by its very name, tended perforce to this final convulsion, resulting
in the separation of the elements of which it was composed. They could
not remain together, and so you see the 'Artists' have come out, and
the 'British' remain&mdash;and peace and sweet obscurity are restored to
Suffolk Street!&mdash;Eh? What? Ha! ha!"</p>

<h3 class="italic">Statistics</h3> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>(p. 211)</span>

<p>Since our interview with Mr. Whistler curious statements have been set
afloat concerning the question of finance ... giving circumstantial

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, July 6, 1888.</span>

evidence of the disaster brought upon the Society by the enforcement
of the Whistlerian policy:&mdash;</p>

<p>This evidence, which is very interesting, is as follows:&mdash;The sales of
the Society during the year 1881 were under £5000; 1882, under £6000;
1883, under £7000; 1884, under £8000; 1885 (the first year of Mr.
Whistler's rule), they fell to under £4000; 1886, under £3000; 1887,
under £2000; and the present year, under £1000.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the fact of the Society having made itself
responsible to Mr. Whistler for a loan raised by him to meet a sudden
expenditure for repairs, is also true; but the unwisdom of the
president and members of any society having money transactions
between <span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>(p. 212)</span> them need hardly be commented upon here....</p>

<p>Mr. Wyke Bayliss, the new president, strikes one as being "a strong
man"&mdash;shrewd, logical, and self-restrained. The author of several
books and pamphlets on the more imaginative realm of art, he is, one
would say, as much permeated by religion as he is by art; to both of
these qualities, curiously enough, his canvases, which usually deal
with cathedral interiors of cheery hue, bear witness.</p>

<p>The hero of three Bond Street "one-man exhibitions," a Board-school
chairman, a lecturer, champion chess-player of Surrey, a member of the
Rochester Diocesan Council, a Shaksperian student, a Fellow of the
Society of Cyclists, a Fellow of the Society of Antiquarians, and
public orator of Noviomagus ... he is surely one of the most versatile
men who ever occupied a presidential chair....</p>

<h3 class="italic">A <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>(p. 213)</span> Retrospect</h3>

<p class="right italic"><span class="right3em">TO THE EDITOR</span><br>
  OF THE "PALL MALL GAZETTE:"</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The Royal Society of British Artists is, perhaps, by this time
again unknown to your agitated readers&mdash;but I would recall a brilliant
number of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> (July 1888), in which mischievous
amusement was sought, with statistics from a newly elected
President&mdash;Mr. Bayliss (Wyke).</p>

<p>Believing it to be, in an official and dull way, more becoming that
the appointed Council of this same Society should deal with the
resulting chaos, I have, until now, waited for a slight washing of
hands, as who should say, on their part as representing the gentle
deprecation of, I assure you, the respectable body in Suffolk Street.</p>

<p>Well, no!&mdash;It was doubtless adjudged wiser, or milder, to "live it
down," and now it, I really believe, behoves <span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>(p. 214)</span> me, in a weary
way, to remind you of the document in question, and, for the sake of
commonplace, uninteresting, and foolish fact, to lift up my parable
and declare fallacious that which was supposed to be true, and
generally to bore myself, and perhaps even you, the all-patient one,
with what, I fear, we others care but little for&mdash;parish matters.</p>

<p>In the article, then, entitled "The Royal Society of British Artists
and its Future&mdash;An Interview with the New President"&mdash;a most appalling
volley of figures was fired off at <span class="italic">brûle-pour-point</span> distance. Under
this deafening detonation I, having no habit, sat for days
incapable&mdash;dreaming vaguely that when a President should see fit to
wash his people's linen in the open, there must be indeed crime at
least on the part of the offender at whose instigation such official
sacrifice of dignity could come about. <span class="italic">I</span> was the offender, and for a
while I sincerely believed that disaster had been brought upon this
Royal Society by my own casual self. But behold, upon closer
inspection, these threatening figures are meretricious and misleading,
as was the building account of the early Philanthropist who, in the
days of St. Paul, meant well, and was abruptly discouraged by that
clear-headed apostle.</p>

<p>Mr. Bayliss tells us that: "The sales of the Society during <span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>(p. 215)</span>
the year 1881 were under," whatever that may mean, "£5000; 1882, under
£6000; 1883, under £7000; 1884, under £8000; in 1885 ('the first year
of Mr. Whistler's rule') they fell to under £4000; 1886, under £3000;
1887, under £2000; and the present year, under £1000."</p>

<p>But also Mr. Bayliss takes this rare occasion of attention, to assert
his various qualifications for his post as head of painters in the
street of Suffolk, and so we learn that he is:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Chairman of the Board-school in his own district," "Champion
chess-player of Surrey," "A member of the Diocesan Council of
Rochester," "Fellow of the Society of Cyclists," and "Public Orator of
Noviomagus."</p>

<p>As chess-player he may have intuitively bethought himself of a
move&mdash;possibly the happy one,&mdash;who knows?&mdash;which in the provinces
obtained him a cup; as Diocesan Councilman he may have supposed
Rochester indifferent to the means used for an end; but as Public
Cyclist of the Royal Society of Noviomagus his experience must be
opposed to any such bluff as going his entire pile on a left bower
only!</p>

<p>When I recovered my courage&mdash;what did I find?&mdash;first my unimpaired
intelligence, and then my memory.</p>

<p>Now, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>(p. 216)</span> to my intelligence, it becomes patent that the chairman
of a Clapham School-board, proposes by his figures to prove, that the
income of the sacrificed Society had of late years steadily
increased:&mdash;"In 1881, under £5000; 1882, under £6000; 1883, under
£7000; 1884, under £8000," until, under the baneful reign of terror
and Whistler in 1885&mdash;"the first year" of the sacrilegious era&mdash;the
receipts fell to £4000&mdash;and have continued to decrease until, in this
present year, they fall to the miserable sum of under a thousand
pounds&mdash;a revelation! discreet, statesmanlike, and worthy the orator
at his best!</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the triumph of such audacious demonstration, my
revived memory points out that Mr. Whistler was only elected President
in June 1886, and, in conformity with the ancient rules and amusing
customs of the venerable body, only came into office six months
afterwards&mdash;that is, practically, in January 1887. Again, with this
last exhibition, he, as everybody knows, had nothing whatever to do.</p>

<p>Immediately, therefore, the conclusion is "quite other" than that put
forth by the Cyclist of his suburb, and we arrive at the, for once,
not unamusing "fact" that the disastrous and simple Painter Whistler
only took in hand the reins of government at least a year after the
former driver had been pitched <span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>(p. 217)</span> from his box, and half the
money-bags had been already lost!&mdash;from £8000 to £4000 at one fatal
swoop! and the beginning of the end had set in! Indeed, this may have
been one of the strong reasons for his own election by an overwhelming
minority of hysterical and panic-stricken passengers.</p>

<p>Now, though he did his best, and cried aloud that the coach was safe,
and called it Royal, and proposed to carry the mail, confidence,
difficult to restore, waited for proof, and although fresh paint was
spread upon the panels, and the President coachman wore his hat with
knowing air, on one side and handled the ribbons lightly, and dandled
the drag, inviting jauntily the passer-by, the public recognized the
ramshackle old "conveyance," and scoffingly refused to trust
themselves in the hearse.</p>

<p>"Four thousand pounds!" down it went&mdash;£3000&mdash;£2000&mdash;the figures are
Wyke's&mdash;and this season, the ignominious "£1000 or under," is none of
my booking! and when last I saw the mad machine it was still cycling
down the hill.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Whistler, they say they only painted out your butterfly
from the signboard, and changed the date. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"What do I say? That they have been guilty of an act of villainous
Vandalism."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me the history of the Board?"</p>

<p>"When I was elected to the presidency of the Society I offered to
paint a signboard which should proclaim to the passer-by the name and
nature of the Society. My offer was accepted, and the Board was sent
down to my studio, where I treated it as I should a most distinguished
sitter&mdash;as a picture or an etching&mdash;throwing my artistic soul into the
Board, which gradually became a Board no longer, as it grew into a
picture. You say they say it was only a butterfly. Mendacity could go
no further. I painted a <span class="italic">lion</span> and a butterfly. The lion lay with the
butterfly&mdash;a harmony in gold and red, with which I had taken as much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>(p. 220)</span> trouble as I did with the best picture I ever painted. And
now they have clothed my golden lion clumsily, awkwardly, and
timorously with a dirty coat of black. My butterfly has gone, the
checks and lines, which I had treated decoratively, have disappeared.
Am I not justified in calling it a piece of gross Vandalism?"</p>

<p>"What course would you have recommended? You had gone; the Board
remained: perhaps it was weather-beaten&mdash;what could they do?"</p>

<p>"They should have taken the Board down, sir, taken the Board down, not
dared to destroy my work&mdash;taken the Board down, returned it to me, and
got another Board of their own to practise on. Good heavens! You say
to my face it was only a Board. You say they <span class="italic">only</span> painted out my
butterfly. It is as if you were condoling with a man who had been
robbed and stripped, and said to him, 'Never mind. It is well it is no
worse. You have escaped easily. Why, you might have had your throat
cut.'"</p>

<p>And Mr. Whistler's Mephistophelian form disappeared into the black of
the night.</p>

<p class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, April 4, 1889.</p>

<p>Mr. Whistler begs me to insert the following note exactly as it
stands. I haven't the slightest idea what it means, but here it is
with "<span class="italic">mes compliments</span>":&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To the Interviewer of the</span> <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>:</p>

<p>"Good! very good! Prettily put, as becomes the <span class="italic">Pall Mall</span>, and yet
you cannot be reproached with being 'too fine for your audience!'</p>

<p>"I wish I <span class="italic">could</span> say these things as you do for me, even at the risk
of, at last, being understood. <span class="italic">Mes Compliments!</span>"</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;As you have considered Mr. Whistler's letter worthy of
publication, I ask you to complete the publication by inserting this
simple statement of the facts as they occurred. The notice board of
the Royal Society of British Artists bears on a red ground, in letters

<span class="sidenoteleft">To the Editor of <span class="italic">The Morning Post</span></span>

of gold, the title of the Society. To this Mr. Whistler, during his
presidency, added with his own hand a decorative device of a lion and
a butterfly. On the eve of our private view it was found that, while
the title of the Society, being in pure gold, remained untarnished,
Mr. Whistler's designs, being executed in spurious metals, had nearly
disappeared, and what little remained of them was of a dirty brown.
The board could not be put up in that state. The lion, however, was
not so badly drawn as to make it necessary to do anything more than
restore it in permanent colour, and that has accordingly been done.
But as the notice board was no longer the actual work of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>(p. 224)</span> Mr.
Whistler, it would manifestly have been improper to have left the
butterfly (his well-known signature) attached to it, even if it had
not appeared in so crushed a state. The soiled butterfly was therefore
effaced.</p>

<p>

<p>Sir&mdash;I have read Mr. Bayliss's letter, and am disarmed. I feel the
folly of kicking against the parish pricks. These things are right in

<p>And when, one of these days, all traces of history shall, by dint of
much turpentine, and more Bayliss, have been effaced from the board
that "belongs to us," I shall be justified, and it will be boldly
denied by some dainty student that the delicate butterfly was <span class="italic">ever</span>
"soiled" in Suffolk Street.</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;The moment has now arrived when, it seems to me proper that, in
your journal, one of the recognized Art organs of the country, should

<span class="sidenoteleft"><span class="italic">The Athenæum</span>, April 27, 1889.</span>

be recorded the details of an incident in which the element of grave
offence is, not unnaturally, quite missed by the people in their
indignation at the insignificance of the object to which public
attention has so unwarrantably been drawn&mdash;a "notice board"!&mdash;the
common sign of commerce!</p>

<p>Now, however slight might be the value of the work in question
destroyed, it is surely of startling interest to know that <span class="italic">work may
be destroyed</span>, or worse still, defaced and tampered with, at the
present moment in full London, with the joyous approval of the major
part of the popular press.</p>

<p>I leave to your comment the fact that in this instance the act is
committed with the tacit consent of a body of gentlemen officially
styled "artists," at the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>(p. 227)</span> instigation of their president, as
he unblushingly acknowledges, and will here distinctly state that the
"notice board of the Royal Society of British Artists" <span class="italic">did not</span> "bear
on a red ground, in letters of gold, the title of the Society," and
that "to this Mr. Whistler, during his presidency," <span class="italic">did not</span> "add
with his own hand a decorative device of a lion and a butterfly." This
damning evidence, though in principle irrelevant&mdash;for what becomes of
the soul of a "Diocesan member of the Council of Clapham" is,
artistically, a matter of small moment&mdash;I nevertheless bring forward
as the only one that will at present be at all considered or even
understood.</p>

<p>The "notice board" was of the familiar blue enamel, well known in
metropolitan use, with white lettering, announcing that the exhibition
of the Incorporated Society of British Artists was held above, and
that for the sum of one shilling the public might enter.</p>

<p>I myself mixed the "red ground," and myself placed, "in letters of
gold, the" <span class="italic">new</span> "title" upon it&mdash;in proper relation to the decorative
scheme of the whole design, of which it formed naturally an
all-important feature. The date was that of the Society's Royal grant,
and in commemoration of its new birth. With the offending Butterfly,
it has now been effaced in one clean sweep of independence, while the
lion, "not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>(p. 228)</span> so badly drawn," was differently dealt with&mdash;it
was found not "necessary to do anything more than restore it in
permanent colour, and that," with a bottle of Brunswick black, "has
accordingly been done;" and, as Mr. Bayliss adds, with unpremeditated
truth, in the thoughtless pride of achievement, "the notice board was
no longer the actual work of Mr. Whistler!"</p>

<p>This exposure of Mr. Bayliss's direct method I have wickedly withheld,
in order that the Philistine impulse of the country should declare
itself in all its freshness of execration before it could be checked
by awkward discovery of mere mendacity, and a timid sense of danger,
called justice.</p>

<p>Everything has taken place as I pleasantly foresaw, and there is by
this time, with the silent exception of one or two cautious dailies,
scarcely a lay paper in the land that has been able to refrain from
joining in the hearty yell of delight at the rare chance of coarsely,
publicly, and safely insulting an artist! In this eagerness to affront
the man they have irretrievably and ridiculously committed themselves
to open sympathy with the destruction of his work.</p>

<p>I wish coldly to chronicle this fact in the archives of the <span class="italic">Athenæum</span>
for the future consideration of the cultured New Zealander.</p>

<p class="center italic">The Ideas of Mr. Blankety Blank on House Decoration</p>

<p>The other day I happened to call on Mr. Blank,&mdash;Japanese Blank, you
know, whose house is in far Fulham. The garden door flew open at my
summons, and my eye was at once confronted with a house, the hue of

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, Dec. 1, 1888.</span>

whose face reminded me of a Venetian palazzo, for it was of a subdued
pink.... If the exterior was Venetian, however, the interior was a
compound of Blank and Japan. Attracted by the curiously pretty hall, I
begged the artist to explain this&mdash;the newest style of house
decoration.</p>

<p>I need not say that Blank, being a man of an <span class="italic">original</span> turn of mind,
with the decorative bump strongly developed, holds what are at present
peculiar views upon wall papers, room tones, and so on. The day is
dark and gloomy, yet once within the halls of Blank there is sweetness
and light.</p>

<p>You <span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>(p. 231)</span> must look through the open door into a luminous little
chamber covered with a soft wash of lemon yellow.</p>

<p>From the antechamber we passed through the open door into a large
drawing-room, of the same soft lemon-yellow hue. The blinds were down,
the fog reigned without, and yet you would have thought that the sun
was in the room.</p>

<p>Here let me pause in my description, and put on record the gist of our
conversation concerning the Home of Taste.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Blank, would you tell me how you came to prefer tones to
papers?"</p>

<p>"Here the walls used to be covered with a paper of a sombre green,
which oppressed me and made me sad," said Blank. 'Why cannot I bring
the sun into the house,' I said to myself, 'even in this land of fog
and clouds?' Then I thought of my experiment and invoked the aid of
the British house-painter. He brought his colours and his buckets, and
I stood over him as he mixed his washes.</p>

<p>"One night, when the work was nearing completion, one of them caught
sight of himself in the mirror, and remarked with astonishment upon
the loveliness of his own features. It was the lemon-yellow
beautifying the British workman's flesh tones.</p>

<p>"I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>(p. 232)</span> assure you the effect of a room full of people in evening
dress seen against the yellow ground is extraordinary, and," added
Blank, "perhaps flattering."</p>

<p>"Then do I understand that you would remove all wall papers?"</p>

<p>"A good ground for distemper," chuckled Mr. Blank.</p>

<p>"But you propose to inaugurate a revolution."</p>

<p>"I don't go so far as that, but I am glad to be able to introduce my
ideas of house furnishing and house decoration to the public," said
Blank, "and I may tell you that when I go to America with my Paris
pictures, I shall try and decorate a house according to my own ideas,
and ask the Americans to think about the matter."</p>

<p>Atlas&mdash;Nothing matters but the unimportant; so, at the risk of
advertising an Australian immigrant of Fulham&mdash;who, like the Kangaroo

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">The World</span>, Dec. 26, 1888.</span>

of his country, is born with a pocket and puts everything into
it&mdash;and, in spite of much wise advice, we ought not to resist the joy
of noticing how readily a hurried contemporary has fallen a prey to
its superficial knowledge of its various departments, and, culminating
in a "Special Edition" last week to embody a lengthy interview headed
"The Home of Taste," has discovered again the nest of the mare that
was foaled years ago!</p>

<p>How, by the way, so smart a paper should have printed its <span class="italic">naïf</span>
emotions of ecstasy before the false colours which the "Kangaroo" has
hoisted over his bush, defies all usual explanation, but clearly the
jaunty reporter whose impudent familiarity, on a former memorable
occasion, achieved my wondering admiration, must have been, in stress
of business, replaced by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>(p. 234)</span> a novice who had never breakfasted
with you and me, Atlas, and the rest of the world, in the
"lemon-yellow," of whose beautiful tone he now, for the first time, is
so completely convinced.</p>

<p>The "hue" on the "face" of the Fulham "Palazzo" he moreover calls
"Venetian," and is pleased with it&mdash;and so was I, Atlas&mdash;<span class="italic">for I mixed
it myself</span>!</p>

<p>And yet, O Atlas, they say that I cannot keep a friend&mdash;my dear, I
cannot afford it&mdash;and <span class="italic">you</span> only keep for me their scalps!</p>

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Truth</span>, March 28, 1889.</span>

According to him this person explained how he managed the press, and
how he claimed to be the inventor of the system associated with the
name of Mr. Whistler. The Art clubs and the studios have been flooded
with the <span class="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</span>. Mr. Whistler sent on his own copy
to the pretender, with the following note:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">"You will blow your brains out, of course. Pigott has shown you
     what to do under the circumstances, and you know your way to
     Spain. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Most Valiant <span class="italic">Truth</span>&mdash;Among your ruthless exposures of the shams of

your late tilt at that arch-impostor and pest of the period&mdash;the

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Truth</span>, Jan. 2, 1890.</span>

all-pervading plagiarist!</p>

<p>I learn, by the way, that in America he may, under the "Law of '84,"
as it is called, be criminally prosecuted, incarcerated, and made to
pick oakum, as he has hitherto picked brains&mdash;and pockets!</p>

<p>How was it that, in your list of culprits, you omitted that fattest of
offenders&mdash;our own Oscar?</p>

<p>His methods are brought again freshly to my mind, by the indefatigable
and tardy Romeike, who sends me newspaper cuttings of "Mr. Herbert
Vivian's Reminiscences," in which, among other entertaining anecdotes,
is told at length, the story of Oscar simulating the becoming pride of
author, upon a certain evening, in the club of the Academy students,
and arrogating <span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>(p. 237)</span> to himself the responsibility of the lecture,
with which, at his earnest prayer, I had, in good fellowship, crammed
him, that he might not add deplorable failure to foolish appearance,
in his anomalous position, as art expounder, before his clear-headed
audience.</p>

<p>He went forth, on that occasion, as my St. John&mdash;but, forgetting that
humility should be his chief characteristic, and unable to withstand
the unaccustomed respect with which his utterances were received, he
not only trifled with my shoe, but bolted with the latchet!</p>

<p>Mr. Vivian, in his book, tells us, further on, that lately, in an
article in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> on the "Decay of Lying," Mr. Wilde
has deliberately and incautiously incorporated, "without a word of
comment," a portion of the well-remembered letter in which, after
admitting his rare appreciation and amazing memory, I acknowledge that
"Oscar has the courage of the opinions ... of others!"</p>

<p>My recognition of this, his latest proof of open admiration, I send
him in the following little note, which I fancy you may think <span class="italic">à
propos</span> to publish, as an example to your readers, in similar
circumstances, of noble generosity in sweet reproof, tempered, as it
should be, to the lamb in his condition:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oscar, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>(p. 238)</span> you have been down the area again, I see!</p>

<p>"I had forgotten you, and so allowed your hair to grow over the sore
place. And now, while I looked the other way, you have stolen <span class="italic">your
own scalp</span>! and potted it in more of your pudding.</p>

<p>"Labby has pointed out that, for the detected plagiarist, there is
still one way to self-respect (besides hanging himself, of course),
and that is for him boldly to declare, 'Je prends mon bien là où je le
trouve.'</p>

<p>"You, Oscar, can go further, and with fresh effrontery, that will
bring you the envy of all criminal <span class="italic">confrères</span>, unblushingly boast,
'Moi, je prends <span class="italic">son</span> bien là où je le trouve!'"</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;I can hardly imagine that the public are in the very smallest
degree interested in the shrill shrieks of "Plagiarism" that proceed

<span class="sidenoteleft"><span class="italic">Truth</span>, Jan. 9, 1890.</span>

from time to time out of the lips of silly vanity or incompetent
mediocrity.</p>

<p>However, as Mr. James Whistler has had the impertinence to attack me
with both venom and vulgarity in your columns, I hope you will allow
me to state that the assertions contained in his letters are as
deliberately untrue as they are deliberately offensive.</p>

<p>The definition of a disciple as one who has the courage of the
opinions of his master is really too old even for Mr. Whistler to be
allowed to claim it, and as for borrowing Mr. Whistler's ideas about
art, the only thoroughly original ideas I have ever heard him express
have had reference to his own superiority as a painter over painters
greater than himself.</p>

<p>It <span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>(p. 240)</span> is a trouble for any gentleman to have to notice the
lucubrations of so ill-bred and ignorant a person as Mr. Whistler, but
your publication of his insolent letter left me no option in the
matter.&mdash;I remain, Sir, faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="right">OSCAR WILDE.</p>

<h3 class="italic">Panic</h3> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>(p. 241)</span>

<p>O truth!&mdash;Cowed and humiliated, I acknowledge that our Oscar is at
last original. At bay, and sublime in his agony, he certainly has, for

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Truth</span>, Jan. 16, 1890.</span>

once, borrowed from no living author, and comes out in his own true
colours&mdash;as his own "gentleman."</p>

<p>How shall I stand against his just anger, and his damning allegations!
for it must be clear to your readers, that, beside his clean polish,
as prettily set forth in his epistle, I, alas! am but the "ill-bred
and ignorant person," whose "lucubrations" "it is a trouble" for him
"to notice."</p>

<p>Still will I, desperate as is my condition, point out that though
"impertinent," "venomous," and "vulgar," he claims me as his
"master"&mdash;and, in the dock, bases his innocence upon such relation
between us.</p>

<p>In all humility, therefore, I admit that the outcome of my "silly
vanity and incompetent mediocrity," must be the incarnation: "Oscar
Wilde." <span class="italic">Mea <span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>(p. 242)</span> culpa!</span> the Gods may perhaps forgive and
forget.</p>

<p>To you, <span class="italic">Truth</span>&mdash;champion of the truth&mdash;I leave the brave task of
proclaiming again that the story of the lecture to the students of the
Royal Academy was, as I told it to you, no fiction.</p>

<p>In the presence of Mr. Waldo Story did Oscar make his prayer for
preparation; and at his table was he entrusted with the materials for
his crime.</p>

<p>You also shall again unearth, in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century Review</span> of
Jan. 1889, page 37, the other appropriated property, slily stowed
away, in an article on "The Decay of Lying"&mdash;though why Decay!</p>

<p>To shirk this matter thus is craven, doubtless; but I am awe-stricken
and tremble, for truly, "the rage of the sheep is terrible!"</p>

what is still in the hands of the printer, cannot possibly have fallen
into the fingers of your incautious contributor!</p>

<p>The early telegram is doubtless the ambition of this smart, though
premature and restless one&mdash;but he is wanting in habit, and unhappy in
his haste!&mdash;What will you? The <span class="italic">Pall Mall</span> and the people have been
imposed upon.</p>

<p>Be good enough, Sir, to insert this note, lest the public suppose,
upon your authority, that the "Ten o'Clock," as yet unseen in the
window of Piccadilly, has, in consequence of this sudden summing up,
been hurriedly withdrawn from circulation.&mdash;I am, Sir,</p>

<p class="right italic">TO THE EDITOR:</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;Just three weeks after publication Mr. Whistler "finds himself
obliged to notice the critical review of the 'Ten o'Clock' that
appeared in your paper." He points out that "what is still in the

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, March 31, 1888.</span>

hands of the printer cannot possibly have fallen into the fingers of
your incautious contributor." I do not pretend to be acquainted with
the multitudinous matters that may be in the hands of his publishers'
printers. But I can declare&mdash;and you, Sir, will corroborate me&mdash;that a
printed copy of Mr. Whistler's smart but misleading lecture was placed
in my hands for review, and, moreover, that the notice did not appear
until the pamphlet was duly advertised by Messrs. Chatto and Windus as
ready. It is, of course, a matter of regret to me if, as Mr. Whistler
suggests, his publishers' interests are likely to suffer from the
review; but if an <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>(p. 246)</span> author's work, in the reviewer's opinion,
be full of rash statement and mischievous doctrine, the publishers
must submit to the risk of frank criticism. But it will be observed
that Mr. Whistler is merely seeking to create an impression that your
Reviewer never saw the work he criticized, which is surely not a
creditable position to take up, even by a sensitive man writhing under
adverse criticism.&mdash;I am, Sir, most obediently,</p>

<p class="right">YOUR REVIEWER.</p>

<h3 class="italic">Testimony</h3> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>(p. 247)</span>

<p class="right italic">TO THE EDITOR:</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;My apologies, I pray you, to the much disturbed gentleman, "Your
Reviewer," who complains that I have allowed "just three weeks" to go

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, April 7, 1888.</span>

by without noticing his writing.</p>

<p>Let me hasten, lest he be further offended, to acknowledge his answer,
in Saturday's paper.</p>

<p>After much matter, he comes unexpectedly upon a clear understanding of
my letter&mdash;"It will be observed," he says naïvely, "that Mr. Whistler
is merely seeking to create an impression that your Reviewer never saw
the work he criticized,"&mdash;herein he is completely right, this is
absolutely the impression I did seek to create&mdash;"which," he continues,
"is surely not a creditable position to take up"&mdash;again I agree with
him, and admit the sad spectacle a "Reviewer" presents in such
position.</p>

<p>He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>(p. 248)</span> further "declares," and calls upon you, Sir, to
"corroborate" him, "that a printed copy of Mr. Whistler's misleading
lecture was placed in my hands for review"&mdash;and moreover, that "the
notice did not appear until the pamphlet was duly advertised by
Messrs. Chatto and Windus as ready."</p>

<p>Pausing to note that if the lecture had not seemed misleading to him,
it would surely not have been worth uttering at all, I come to the
copy in question&mdash;this could only have been a printed proof, quaintly
acquired&mdash;as will be seen by the following letter from Messrs. Chatto
and Windus, which I must beg you Sir, to publish, with this note&mdash;as
it deals also with the remaining point, the advertisement of the
pamphlet,</p>

<p class="center">And, I am, Sir,

<p class="quote"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;In reply to your question we have to say that we

justly be required of the average witness; it cannot be expected, it
should not be exacted, of any critical writer or lecturer on any form
of art....</p>

<p>... And it appears to one at least of those unfortunate "outsiders"
for whose judgment or whose "meddling" Mr. Whistler has so imperial
and Olympian a contempt....</p>

<p>Let us begin at the end, as all reasonable people always do: we shall
find that Mr. Whistler concedes to Greek art a place beside Japanese.
Now this, on his own showing, will never do; it crosses, it
contravenes, it nullifies, it pulverizes his theory or his principle

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">REFLECTION:</span><br>

<span class="floatright">

of artistic limitation. If Japanese art is right in confining itself
to what can be "broidered upon the fan"&mdash;and the gist of the whole
argument is in favour of this assumption&mdash;then the sculpture which
appeals, indeed, first of all to our perception of beauty, to the
delight of the eye, to the wonder and the worship of the instinct or
the sense, but which in every possible instance appeals also to far
other intuitions and far other sympathies than these, is as absolutely
wrong, as demonstrably inferior, as any picture or as any carving
which may be so degenerate and so debased as to concern itself with a
story or a subject. Assuredly Phidias thought of other things than
"arrangements"[34]

<span class="sidenoteleft" title="Footnote 34"><span class="tiny">[34]</span><span class="italic">REFLECTION:</span><br>

in marble&mdash;as certainly as Æschylus thought of
other things than "arrangements" in metre. Nor, I am sorely afraid,
can the adored Velasquez be promoted to a seat "at the foot of
Fusi-yama." Japanese art is not merely the incomparable achievement of
certain harmonies in colour; <span class="italic">it is the negation, the immolation, the
annihilation of everything else</span>. By the code which accepts as the
highest of models and of masterpieces the cups and fans and screens
with which "the poor world"

<span class="sidenoteleft"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>(p. 251)</span> <span class="italic">REFLECTION:</span><br>
              "Cups and fans and screens," and Hamilton vases, and

has been as grievously "pestered" of late
years as ever it was in Shakespeare's time "with such
waterflies"&mdash;"diminutives of nature"&mdash;as excited the scorn of his
moralizing cynic, Velasquez is as unquestionably condemned as is
Raphael or Titian. It is true that this miraculous power of hand
(?)[35]

<span class="sidenoteright" title="Footnote 35"><span class="tiny">[35]</span><span class="italic">REFLECTION:</span><br>
              Quite hopeless!<br>

makes beautiful for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>(p. 252)</span> us the deformity of dwarfs, and
dignifies the degradation of princes; but that is not the question. It
is true, again, that Mr. Whistler's own merest "arrangements" in
colour are lovely and effective;[36]

<span class="sidenoteright" title="Footnote 36"><span class="tiny">[36]</span><span class="italic">REFLECTION:</span><br>
              Whereby it would seem that, for the Bard, the lovely is
              not necessarily "effective."<br>
<span class="floatright">
<img src="images/img099_p271a.jpg" width="50" height="51" alt="Butterfly" title=""></span></span>

but his portraits, to speak of
these alone, are liable to the damning and intolerable imputation of
possessing not merely other qualities than these, but qualities which
actually appeal&mdash;I blush to remember and I shudder to record it&mdash;which
actually appeal to the intelligence[37]

<span class="sidenoteleft" title="Footnote 37"><span class="tiny">[37]</span><span class="italic">REFLECTION:</span><br>
              The "lovely," therefore, confessedly does not appeal to
              the intelligence, emotions, mind, and heart of the Bard
              even when aided by the "effective."<br>
<span>
<img src="images/img100_p271b.jpg" width="50" height="59" alt="Butterfly" title=""></span></span>

and the emotions, to the mind
and heart of the spectator. It would be quite useless for Mr. Whistler
to protest&mdash;if haply he should be so disposed&mdash;that he never meant to
put study of character and revelation of intellect into his portrait
of Mr. Carlyle, or intense pathos of significance and tender depth of
expression into the portrait of his own venerable mother. The
scandalous fact remains, that he has done so; and in so doing has
explicitly violated and implicitly abjured the creed and the canons,
the counsels and the catechism of Japan....</p>

<p>And when Mr. Whistler informs us that "there never was an artistic
period," we must reply that the statement, so far as it is true, is
the flattest of all possible truisms; for no mortal ever maintained
that there ever was a period in which all men were either good
artists or good judges of art. But when we pass from the positive to
the comparative degree of historic or retrospective criticism, we must
ask whether the lecturer means to say that there have not been times
when the general standard of taste and judgment,

<span class="sidenoteleft"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>(p. 253)</span> <span class="italic">REFLECTION:</span><br>

              Of course I do mean this thing&mdash;though most imprudent
              was the saying of it!&mdash;for this Art truth the Poet
              resents with the people.&mdash;June 1888.<br>
<span>
<img src="images/img101_p272.jpg" width="50" height="53" alt="Butterfly" title=""></span></span>

reason and
perception, was so much higher than at other times and such periods
may justly and accurately be defined as artistic. If he does mean to
say this, he is beyond answer and beneath confutation; in other words,
he is where an artist of Mr. Whistler's genius and a writer of Mr.
Whistler's talents can by no possibility find himself. If he does not
mean to say this, what he means to say is exactly as well worth
saying, as valuable and as important a piece of information, as the
news that Queen Anne is no more, or that two and two are not generally
supposed to make five.</p>

<p>But if the light and glittering bark of this brilliant amateur in the
art of letters is not invariably steered with equal dexterity of hand
between the Scylla and Charybdis of paradox and platitude, it is
impossible that in its course it should not once and again touch upon
some point worth notice, if not exploration. Even that miserable
animal the "unattached writer" may gratefully and respectfully
recognize his accurate apprehension and his felicitous application of
well-nigh the most hackneyed verse in all the range of
Shakespeare's&mdash;which yet is almost invariably misconstrued and
misapplied&mdash;"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin;" and this,
as the poet goes on to explain, is that all, with one consent, prefer
worthless but showy novelties to precious but familiar possessions.
"This one chord that vibrates with all," says Mr. Whistler, who
proceeds to cite artistic examples of the lamentable fact, "this one
unspoken sympathy that pervades humanity, is&mdash;Vulgarity." But the
consequence which he proceeds to indicate and to deplore is calculated
to strike his readers with a sense of mild if hilarious astonishment.
It is that men of sound judgment and pure taste, quick feelings and
clear perceptions, most unfortunately and most inexplicably begin to
make their voices "heard in the land." Porson, as all the world knows,
observed of the Germans of his day that "in Greek" they were "sadly to
seek." It is no discredit to Mr. Whistler if this is his case also;
but then he would do well to eschew the use of a Greek term lying so
far out of the common way as the word "æsthete."

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>(p. 254)</span> <span class="italic">REFLECTION:</span><br>

<span>
<img src="images/img102_p273.jpg" width="50" height="68" alt="Butterfly" title=""></span></span>

Not merely the only
accurate meaning, but the only possible meaning, of that word is
nothing more, but nothing less, than this&mdash;an intelligent,
appreciative, quick-witted person; in a word, as the lexicon has it,
"one who perceives." The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>(p. 255)</span> man who is no æsthete stands
confessed, by the logic of language and the necessity of the case, as
a thick-witted, tasteless, senseless, and impenetrable blockhead. I do
not wish to insult Mr. Whistler, but I feel bound to avow my
impression that there is no man now living who less deserves the
honour of enrolment in such ranks as these&mdash;of a seat in the synagogue
of the anæsthetic....</p>

<p>... Such abuse of language is possible only to the drivelling
desperation of venomous or fangless duncery: it is in higher and
graver matters, of wider bearing and of deeper import, that we find it
necessary to dispute the apparently serious propositions or assertions
of Mr. Whistler. <span class="italic">How far the witty tongue may be thrust into the
smiling cheek</span> when the lecturer pauses to take breath between these
remarkably brief paragraphs it would be certainly indecorous and
possibly superfluous to inquire. But his theorem is unquestionably
calculated to provoke the loudest and the heartiest mirth that ever
acclaimed the advent of Momus or Erycina. For it is this&mdash;that

<span class="sidenoteleft" title="Footnote 38"><span class="tiny">[38]</span><span class="italic">REFLECTION:</span><br>

              Is not, then, the funeral hymn a gladness to the singer,
              if the verse be beautiful?<br>

              Certainly the funeral monument, to be worthy the
              Nation's sorrow buried beneath it, must first be a joy
              to the sculptor who designed it.<br>

              The Bard's reasoning is of the People. His Tragedy is

remembered that they were not in a serious world; that they were in

and all the
fortuitous frippery of Fusi-yama.</p>

<p>It is a cruel but an inevitable Nemesis which reduces even a man of
real genius, keen-witted and sharp-sighted, to the level of the critic
Jobson, to the level of the <span class="italic">dotard and the dunce</span>, when paradox is
discoloured by personality and merriment is distorted by
malevolence.(!) No man who really knows the qualities of Mr.
Whistler's best work will imagine that he really believes the highest
expression of his art to be realized in reproduction of the grin and
glare, the smirk and leer, of Japanese womanhood as represented in its
professional types of beauty; but to all appearance he would fain
persuade us that he does.</p>

<p>In the latter of the two portraits to which I have already referred
there is an expression of living character.... This, however, is an
exception to the general rule of Mr. Whistler's way of work: an
exception, it may be alleged, which proves the rule. A single
infraction of the moral code, a single breach of artistic law,
suffices to vitiate the position of the preacher. And this is no
slight escapade, or casual aberration; it is a full and frank
defiance, a deliberate and elaborate denial, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>(p. 257)</span> hurled right in
the face of Japanese jocosity, flung straight in the teeth of the
theory which condemns high art, under penalty of being considered
intelligent, to remain eternally on the grin.</p>

<p>If it be objected that to treat this theorem gravely is "to consider
too curiously" the tropes and the phrases of <span class="italic">a jester</span> of genius, I
have only to answer that it very probably may be so, but that the
excuse for such error must be sought in the existence of the genius. A
man of genius is scarcely at liberty to choose whether he shall or
shall not be considered as a serious figure&mdash;one to be acknowledged
and respected as an equal or a superior, not applauded and dismissed
as <span class="italic">a tumbler or a clown</span>. And if the better part of Mr. Whistler's
work as an artist is to be accepted as the work of a serious and
intelligent creature, it would seem incongruous and preposterous to
dismiss the more characteristic points of his theory as a lecturer
with the chuckle or the shrug of mere amusement or amazement.
Moreover, if considered as a joke, a mere joke, and nothing but a
joke, this gospel of the grin has hardly matter or meaning enough in
it to support so elaborate a structure of paradoxical rhetoric. It
must be taken, therefore, as something serious in the main; and if so
taken, and read by the light reflected from Mr. Whistler's more
characteristically brilliant canvases, it may not improbably recall a
certain phrase of Molière's which at once passed into a proverb&mdash;"Vous
êtes orfèvre, M. Josse." That worthy tradesman, it will be remembered,
was of opinion that nothing could be so well calculated to restore a
drooping young lady to mental and physical health as the present of a
handsome set of jewels.

<p>It is reported that Mr. Whistler, having received word that a drawing
of his had been rejected by the Committee of the Universal Exhibition,
arrived yesterday in Paris and withdrew all his remaining works,
including an oil painting and six drawings. The French consider that
he has been guilty of a breach of good manners. The <span class="italic">Paris</span>, for
instance, points out that, after sending his works to the jury, he
should have accepted their judgment, and appealed to the public by
other methods.</p>

<p class="right italic">TO THE EDITOR:</p>

<p class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, April 27, 1889.</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;You are badly informed&mdash;a risk you constantly run in your haste
for pleasing news.</p>

<p>I have not "withdrawn" my works "from the forthcoming Paris
Exhibition."</p>

<p>I transported my pictures from the American department to the British
section of the "Exposition Internationale," where I prefer to be
represented.</p>

<p>"The French" have nothing, so far, to do with English or American

<h3 class="italic">Whistler's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>(p. 266)</span> Grievance</h3>

<p class="right italic">AN ENTRAPPED INTERVIEW.</p>

<p>The <span class="italic">Herald</span> correspondent saw Mr. Whistler at the Hôtel Suisse, and
asked the artist about his affairs with the American Art Jury of the
Exhibition.</p>

<p class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">New York Herald</span>, Paris Edition, Oct. 3,
              1889.</p>

<p>"I believe the <span class="italic">Herald</span> made the statement," said Mr. Whistler, "that
I had withdrawn all my etchings and a full-length portrait from the
American section. It all came about in this way: In the first place,
before the pictures were sent in, I received a note from the American
Art Department asking me to contribute some of my work. It was at that
time difficult for me to collect many of my works; but I borrowed what
I could from different people, and sent in twenty-seven etchings and
the portrait."</p>

<p>"You can imagine that a few etchings do not have any effect at all; so
I sent what I could get together. Shortly afterwards I received a note
saying: 'Sir&mdash;Ten <span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>(p. 267)</span> of your exhibits have not received the
approval of the jury. Will you kindly remove them?'"</p>

<p>"At the bottom of this note was the name 'Hawkins'&mdash;General Hawkins, I
believe&mdash;a cavalry officer, who had charge of the American Art
Department of the Exhibition.</p>

<p>"Well! the next day I went to Paris and called at the American
headquarters of the Exhibition. I was ushered into the presence of
this gentleman, Hawkins, to whom I said:&mdash;'I am Mr. Whistler, and I
believe this note is from you. I have come to remove my etchings'; but
I did not mention that my work was to be transferred to the English
Art Section."</p>

<p>"'Ah!' said the gentleman&mdash;the officer&mdash;'we were very sorry not to
have had space enough for all your etchings, but we are glad to have
seventeen and the portrait."</p>

<p>"'You are too kind' I said, 'but really I will not trouble you.'"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hawkins was quite embarrassed, and urged me to reconsider my
determination, but I withdrew every one of the etchings, and they are
now well hung in the English Department."</p>

<p>"I did not mind the fact that my works were criticized, but it was the
discourteous manner in which it was done. If the request to me had
been made <span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>(p. 268)</span> in proper language, and they had simply
said:&mdash;'Mr. Whistler, we have not space enough for twenty-seven
etchings. Will you kindly select those which you prefer, and we shall
be glad to have them,' I would have given them the privilege of
placing them in the American Section."...</p>

<h3>"<span class="italic">Whacking <span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269"></a>(p. 269)</span> Whistler</span>"</h3>

<p>In an interview in yesterday's <span class="italic">Herald</span> the eccentric artist, Mr. J.
McNeill Whistler, "jumped" in a most emphatic manner upon General

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">New York Herald</span>, Paris Edition, Oct. 4.
              1889.</span>

Hawkins, Commissioner of the American Art Department at the
Exhibition. He objects to the General for being a cavalry officer;
refers to him sarcastically as "Hawkins," and declares him ignorant of
the most elementary principles alike of art and politeness&mdash;all this
because he, Whistler, was requested by the Commissioner to remove from
the Exhibition premises some ten of his rejected etchings.</p>

<p>In a spirit of fair play a correspondent called upon General Hawkins,
giving him an opportunity, if he felt so disposed, of "jumping," in
his turn, on his excitable opponent. The General did feel "so
disposed," and proceeded, in popular parlance, to "see" Mr. J. McNeill
Whistler and "go him one better." In this species of linguistic
gymnastics, by the way, the military <span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>(p. 270)</span> Commissioner asks no
odds of any one. He began by gently remarking that Mr. Whistler, in
his published remarks, had soared far out of the domain of strict
veracity. This was not bad for a "starter," and was ably supported by
the following detailed statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Whistler says he received a note from me. That is a mistake. I
have never in my life written a line to Mr. Whistler.[40]

<span class="sidenoteright" title="Footnote 40"><span class="tiny">[40]</span>The official memory:<br>

              "<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;I wish by return mail you would send
              description for oils; and if you desire to have titles
              to etchings printed, you will have to furnish the
              necessary material for copy.&mdash;Yours faithfully,<br>
<span class="smcap">Rush C. Hawkins</span>,<br>
Commissariat General, Paris, March 29, 1889.<br>
  (<span class="italic">Autograph.</span>)<br>
              To Mr. Whistler."</span>

What he did
receive was a circular with my name printed at the bottom. These
circulars were sent to all the artists who had pictures refused by the
jury, and contained a simple request that such pictures be removed.</p>


<p>"Our way of doing business was not, it seems, up to Mr. Whistler's
standard of politeness, so he got angry and took away, not only the
ten rejected etchings, but seventeen others which had been accepted.
It is a little singular that among about one hundred and fifty artists
who received this circular, Mr. Whistler should have been the only one
to discover its latent discourtesy. How great must be Mr. Whistler's
capacity for detecting a snub where none exists!"</p>

<p>"In any case, there is not the slightest reason for Mr. Whistler's
venting his ire upon me. I had no more to do with either accepting or
rejecting his pictures <span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>(p. 271)</span> than I had with painting them. What
he sent us was judged on its merits by a competent and impartial jury
of his peers. If there were ten etchings rejected it only shows that
there were ten etchings not worthy of acceptance. A few days after the
affair a trio of journalists&mdash;not all men either&mdash;came to me,
demanding that I reverse this 'iniquitous decision,' as they styled
it. I told these three prying scribblers in a polite way that if they
would kindly attend to their own affairs I would try to attend to
mine. In this connection, I may remark that there are in Paris a
number of correspondents who ought not to be allowed within gun-shot
of a newspaper office."</p>

<p>"The next mis-statement in Mr. Whistler's interview is in regard to
the ultimate disposal of his important etchings. His words are:&mdash;'Mr.
Hawkins was quite embarrassed, and urged me to reconsider my
determination, but I withdrew every one of the etchings, and they are
now well hung in the English department.'"</p>

<p>"Now, I leave it to any fair-minded person if the plain inference from
this statement is not that the whole twenty-seven etchings were
accepted by the English department. If not, what in heaven's name is
he crowing about? But the truth is that while we rejected <span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>(p. 272)</span>
only <span class="italic">ten</span> of his etchings, the English department rejected <span class="italic">eighteen</span>
of them, and of the nine accepted only hung two on the line. Had Mr.
Whistler been the possessor of a more even temper and a little more
common sense, he would have had five or six of his works on the line
in the American department, and nearly twice as many on exhibition
than is actually the case. Really, I fail to see what he gained by the
exchange, unless it was a valuable experience. He says I was
embarrassed when I saw him; I fancy he will be embarrassed when he
sees these facts in 'cold type.'"</p>

<h3>"<span class="italic">Whistler's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span> Grievance</span>"</h3>

<p class="right italic">TO THE EDITOR:</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;I beg that you will kindly print immediately these, my regrets,
that General Rush Hawkins should have been spurred into unwonted and
unbecoming expression by what I myself read with considerable

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">New York Herald.</span></span>

bewilderment in the <span class="italic">New York Herald</span>, October 3, under the head of
"Whistler's Grievance."</p>

<p>I can assure the gallant soldier that I have no grievance.</p>

<p>Had I known that, when&mdash;over what takes the place of wine and walnuts
in Holland&mdash;I remembered lightly the military methods of the jury, I
was being "interviewed," I should have adopted as serious a tone as
the original farce would admit of; or I might have even refused to be
a party at all to the infliction upon your readers of so old and
threadbare a story as that of the raid upon the works of art in the
American section of the Universal Exhibition.</p>

<p>Your <span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>(p. 274)</span> correspondent, I fancy, felt much more warmly, than did
I, wrongs that&mdash;who knows?&mdash;are doubtless rights in the army; and my
sympathies, I confess, are completely with the General, who did only,
as he complains, his duty in that state of life in which it had
pleased God, and the War Department, to call him, when, according to
order, he signed that naïvely authoritative note, circular, warrant,
or what not&mdash;for he did irretrievably fasten his name to it, whether
with pen or print, thereby hopelessly making the letter his own. Thus
have we responsibility, like greatness, sometimes thrust upon us.</p>

<p>On receipt of the document I came&mdash;I saw the commanding officer, who,
until now, I fondly trusted, would ever remember me as pleasantly as I
do himself&mdash;and, knowing despatch in all military matters to be of
great importance, I then and there relieved him of the troublesome
etchings, and carried off the painting.</p>

<p>It is a sad shock to me to find that the good General speaks of me
without affection, and that he evinces even joy when he says with a
view to my entire discomfiture:&mdash;"While we rejected only ten of his
etchings, the English department rejected eighteen of them, and of the
nine accepted, only hung two on the line."</p>

<p>Now, he is wrong!&mdash;the General is wrong.</p>

<p>The etchings now hanging in the English section&mdash;and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>(p. 275)</span> perfect
is their hanging, notwithstanding General Hawkins's flattering
anxiety&mdash;are the only ones I sent there.</p>

<p>In the haste and enthusiasm of your interviewer, I have, on this
point, been misunderstood.</p>

<p>There was moreover here no question of submitting them to a "competent
and impartial jury of his peers"&mdash;one of whom, by the way, I am
informed upon undoubted authority, had never before come upon an
"etching" in his hitherto happy and unchequered Western career.</p>

<p>We all knew that the space allotted to the English department was
exceedingly limited, and each one refrained from abusing it. Here I
would point out again, hoping this time to be clearly understood,
that, had the methods employed in the American camp been more civil,
if less military, all further difficulties might have been avoided.
Had I been properly advised that the room was less than the demand for
place, I would, of course, have instantly begged the gentlemen of the
jury to choose, from among the number, what etchings they pleased. So
the matter would have ended, and you, Sir, would have been without
this charming communication!</p>

<p>The pretty embarrassment of General Hawkins on the occasion of my
visit, I myself liked, thinking it seemly, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>(p. 276)</span> and part of the
good form of a West Point man, who is taught that a drum-head court
martial&mdash;and what else in the experience of this finished officer
should so fit him for sitting in judgment upon pictures?&mdash;should be
presided at with grave and softened demeanour.</p>

<p>If I mistook the General's manner, it is another illusion the less.</p>

<p><span class="left40">And I have, Sir,</span><br>
<span class="left50">the honour to be,</span><br>
<span class="left60">Your obedient servant,</span></p>

<h3 class="italic">The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>(p. 277)</span> Art-Critic's Friend</h3>

<p>Mr. Whistler has many things to answer for, and not the least of them
is the education of the British Art-Critic. That, at any rate, is the
impression left by a little book made up&mdash;apparently against the
writer's will&mdash;of certain of the master's letters and <span class="italic">mots</span>.... It is

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">The Scots Observer</span>, April 5, 1890.</span>

useful and pleasant reading; for not only does it prove the painter to
have a certain literary talent&mdash;of aptness, unexpectedness, above all
impertinence&mdash;but also it proves him never to have feared the face of
art-critical man.... To him the art-critic is nothing if not a person
to be educated, with or against the grain; and when he encounters him
in the ways of error, he leaps upon him joyously, scalps him in print
before the eyes of men, kicks him gaily back into the paths of truth
and soberness, and resumes his avocation with that peculiar zest an
act of virtue does undoubtedly impart. Indeed, Mr. Whistler, so far
from being the critic's enemy, is on the contrary the best friend
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>(p. 278)</span> that tradesman has ever had. For his function is to make him
ridiculous....</p>

<p>... Yes, Mr. Whistler is often "rowdy" and unpleasant; in his last
combat with Mr. Oscar Wilde&mdash;("Oscar, you have been down the area
again")&mdash;he comes off a palpable second; his treatment of 'Arry dead
and "neglected by the parish" goes far to prove that his sense of
smell is not so delicate nor so perfectly trained as his sense of
sight....</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;It is, I suppose, to your pleasant satisfaction in "The Critic's

<span class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">The Scots Observer</span>, April 19, 1890.</span>

with proud mark, in the blue pencil of office, whereby the impatient
author hastened to indicate the pithy personal paragraphs, that no
time should be wasted upon other matter with which the periodical is
ballasted.</p>

<p>Exhilarated by the belief that I had been remembered&mdash;for vanity's
sake let me fancy that you have bestowed upon me your own thought and
hand&mdash;I plunged forthwith into the underlined article, and read with
much amusement your excellent appreciation.</p>

<p>Having forgotten none of your professional manner as art arbiter, may
I say that I can picture to myself easily the sad earnestness with
which you now point the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>(p. 280)</span> thick thumb of your editorial
refinement in deprecation of my choicer "rowdyism"? And knowing your
analytical conscientiousness, I can even understand the humble comfort
you take in Oscar's meek superiority; but, for the life of me, I
cannot follow your literary intention when you say that my care of
"''Arry,' dead and neglected by the parish," goes far to prove that my
"sense of smell is not so delicate nor so perfectly trained as" my
"sense of sight."</p>

<p>Do you mean that my discovery of the body is the result of a cold in
the head? and that, with a finer scent, I should have missed it
altogether? or were you only unconsciously remembering and dreamily
dipping your pen into the ink of my former description of "'Arry's"

<p>Sir,&mdash;I have read with interest Mr. Whistler's letter in your issue of

day and saw the picture he refers to. It was not on public exhibition,
but was in one of their private rooms, and was brought out for my
inspection <span class="italic">à propos</span> of a conversation we were having. Now, so far
from Messrs. Dowdeswell showing it as a "completed work," they
distinctly spoke of it as unfinished; nor can I imagine any one
acquainted with Mr. Whistler's works speaking of any of them as
"completed!" In "L'Envoi" of the catalogue of his exhibition held at
Messrs. Dowdeswell's a short time ago I find the following paragraph
from his pen:&mdash;"The work of the master reeks not of the sweat of the
brow&mdash;suggests no effort&mdash;and <span class="italic">is finished from its beginning</span>." The
only inference possible is either that Mr. Whistler is not a master,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>(p. 290)</span> or that the work is finished! He has, however, spent what
time he could spare from his literary labours in endeavouring to
induce the world to believe that the slightest scratch from his pen is
worthy to rank with "Las Lanzas," and I am therefore surprised to
learn that he has altered his opinion. Still, I quite agree with him
when he tells us that some of his work is "absolutely worthless!"&mdash;I
am, sir, more in sorrow than in anger, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right italic">TO THE EDITOR:</p>

<p class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, Aug. 4, 1891.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;My letter should have met with no reply at all. It was a
statement&mdash;authoritative and unanswerable, if there ever were one.</p>

<p>Because of the attention drawn to it, in the press, I felt called upon
to advise the Public that one of <span class="italic">my own works</span> is condemned <span class="italic">by
myself</span>. Final this, one would fancy!</p>

<p>That the accidental owners of the Gallery should introduce themselves
to the situation, is of a most marked irrelevancy. They come in <span class="italic">comme
un cheveu sur la soupe</span>, to be removed at once.</p>

<p>The dealer's business is to buy and sell. In the course of such
traffic, these same busy picture bodies, without consulting me, put
upon the market a painting that I, the author, intended to
efface&mdash;and, thanks to your courtesy, I have been enabled to say so
effectually in your journal.</p>

<p>All <span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>(p. 292)</span> along have I carefully destroyed plates, torn up proofs,
and burned canvases, that the truth of the quoted word shall prevail,
and that the future collector shall be spared the mortification of
cataloguing his pet mistakes.</p>

<p>To destroy, is to remain.</p>

<p>What is commercial irritation beside a clean canvas?</p>

<p>What is a gentlemanly firm in Bond Street beside Eternity?&mdash;I am, sir,
your obedient servant,</p>

<p>"It is bad enough, in all conscience, to be caricatured by the gifted
pencil and brushes of the admirable Whistler; and it is surely adding
insult to injury to describe the victims and sufferers as
'Arrangements.' With regard to Mr. Whistler's Symphonies, Harmonies,
and so on, we will relate a parable. Here it is:&mdash;A lively young
donkey sang a sweet love song to the dawn, and so disturbed all the
neighbourhood, that the neighbours went to the donkey and begged him
to desist. He continued his braying for some time, and then ended with
what appeared, to his own ears, a flourish of surpassing brilliancy.</p>

<p>"Will you be good enough to give over that hideous noise?" said the
neighbours.</p>

<p>"'Good Olympus!' said the donkey, 'did you say hideous noise? Why,
that is a "Symphony," which means a concord of sweet sounds, as you
may see by referring to any dictionary.'</p>

<p>"'But,' said the neighbours, 'we do <span class="italic">not</span> think that "Symphony" is the
word to describe your performance. "Cacophony" would be more correct,
and that means "a bad set of sounds."'</p>

<p>"'How <span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>(p. 312)</span> absurdly you talk!' said the donkey. 'I will refer it
to my fellow-asses, and let them decide.'</p>

<p>"The donkeys decided that the young donkey's song was a most
symphonious and harmonious, sweet song; so he continues to bray as
melodiously as ever. There is, we believe, a moral to this parable, if

<p class="sidenoteright"><span class="italic">The World</span>, Mar. 30, 1892.</p>

<p><span class="italic">You</span> know these things, Atlas&mdash;perhaps he is right, and curiously
microscopic&mdash;for surely here we have "a difference without a
distinction!"</p>

<p>However, R.A. or A.R.A., and, in my opinion he deserves to be both, I
personally owe Mr. Jones a friendly gratitude which I am pleased to
acknowledge; for rare indeed is the courage with which, on the first
public occasion, he sacrificed himself, in the face of all-astounded
etiquette, and future possible ridicule, in order to help write the
history of another.</p>

<p>These things we like to remember, Atlas, you and I&mdash;the bright things,
the droll things, the charming things of this pleasant life&mdash;and here,
too, in this lovely land they are understood&mdash;and keenly appreciated.</p>

<p>As to those others&mdash;alas! I am afraid we have done <span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>(p. 334)</span> with
them. It was our amusement to convict&mdash;they thought we cared to
convince!</p>

<p><span class="italic">Allons!</span> They have served our wicked purpose&mdash;Atlas, we "collect" no
more.</p>
